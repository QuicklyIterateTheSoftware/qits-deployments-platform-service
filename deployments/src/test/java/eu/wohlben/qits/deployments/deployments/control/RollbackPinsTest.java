/**
 * The pin rule, case by case. Plain JUnit — the rule's whole input is "which rows exist, in what
 * order", so nothing here needs a running application or a database.
 *
 * <p>The first four cases are the ones qits-artifacts' OCI collector held before the policy moved
 * here, restated in cd's own vocabulary; the fifth is the question cd's data can answer and the
 * collector's could not — a row that never served.
 *
 * <p>Shas are written as full 40-hex commit shas because that is what a deployment row carries and
 * what post-receive pushes as an image tag.
