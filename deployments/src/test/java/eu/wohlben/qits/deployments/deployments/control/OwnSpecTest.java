/**
 * This repository deploys ITSELF, so its own {@code .config/qits/deployments.yml} is the one spec on
 * the estate whose reader is in the same reactor — and the only one a build here can hold to account.
 * {@code OwnDeclarationTest} is the sibling for the other file; this is the same idea for the one
 * that decides where the container runs.
 *
 * <p><b>Unlike the declaration, this file IS parsed here, with the real parser.</b> The argument that
 * keeps {@code OwnDeclarationTest} from being a parser — qits-configuration owns that grammar and a
 * second opinion would disagree with it — runs the other way round for this document:
 * {@link DeploymentSpecParser} is this component's own, a spec is fetched at the released tag, and an
 * unknown key fails a deployment. So parsing it here is not a second opinion, it is the only opinion.
 *
 * <p><b>What it pins is the self-deploy's health gate.</b> {@link DeployService#resolveHealthPath}
 * asks the spec, then the STORED {@code pd_service.health_path} row, then {@link
 * DeployService#conventionHealthPath} — and the three agree now that the route segment and the
 * application name do. So this file states NO {@code health_path:}, and the assertion is that it
 * states none and that the convention derives the path the service actually serves. A key here would
 * be a second spelling of that string, free to drift from the route the image bakes in.
 *
 * <p>The key was present for exactly one release and was load-bearing then: the stored row held
 * {@code /platform-deployments/q/health/ready}, written when the route really was there, and a
 * stored row beats the convention. The route moved on 2026-09-26, the row was re-registered with the
 * served path, and the override came out. <b>Re-adding it is the regression this test names</b>, not
 * removing it.
