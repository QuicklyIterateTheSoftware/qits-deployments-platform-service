/**

 * could hurt). The names, branches and health paths the topology keeps are checked by {@code

 *
 * <p>The two derived conventions are pinned here too, because they are the same kind of claim: an
 * image reference and a container name are strings this component composes and a publisher, an
 * operator or a bootstrap grep has to be able to predict.
