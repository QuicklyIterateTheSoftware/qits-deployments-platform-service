/**
 * What the schema itself promises, against a real PostgreSQL with the real migration — plain JUnit,
 * no Quarkus, because the subject is the SQL.
 *
 * <p><b>Real postgres, not an in-memory stand-in.</b> The store moved off H2 with the resource
 * mechanism, and two of the claims below exist only on the database that ships: identity columns
 * and {@code unique nulls not distinct}. {@link EmbeddedPg} spawns the binaries as a child process,
 * so this still needs no docker.
 *
 * <p>Each test migrates its OWN database, so one test's rows are never another's starting state.
 * The claims:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the ordering column is the <b>database's</b> and is monotonic, because the deployment
 *       listings read "the current one per application" straight off it and {@code created_at} ties
 *       for the rows one build-succeeded event writes;
 *   <li>a deployment row needs <b>no topology row</b> — no FK, so history outlives the service and
 *       the tier it names, which is what keeps the rollback pins answering;
 *   <li>the startup sweep's predecessor lookup, as SQL: {@code (application_name, environment_id)}
 *       has to match across a <b>null</b> tier. This is the query that decides whether a
 *       self-updating deployer comes back ACTIVE or comes back having failed its own deployment,
 *       and nulls are distinct to {@code =} — so it is written with an explicit null test and
 *       pinned here;
 *   <li>and the same fact from the other side on {@code pd_resource}: its uniqueness is declared
 *       {@code nulls not distinct}, so the platform plane — whose {@code environment_name} is null
 *       — gets one row per resource rather than one per deployment.
 * </ul>
