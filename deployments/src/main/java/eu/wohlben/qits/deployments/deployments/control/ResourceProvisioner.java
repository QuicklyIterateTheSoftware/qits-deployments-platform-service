/**
 * The seam between this component's orchestration and the platform's postgres — the {@link
 * DeploymentDriver} arrangement for the third time: this module owns the interface and the state
 * machine that calls it, {@code service/pghost} owns the sole production implementation (plain
 * JDBC), and the suites install a scripted fake so a clone's {@code mvn verify} reaches no database
 * it did not start itself.
 *
 * <p><b>Three seams now, and they are the same rule applied three times.</b> Everything this
 * component cannot do inside its own process — shell out to docker, fetch a file over HTTP, speak
 * DDL to somebody else's server — is an interface here and an implementation over there.
 *
 * <p><b>It provisions and it never destroys.</b> There is no drop in this vocabulary and none is
 * coming: a database is the one thing a deployment can take away that a redeploy cannot give back.
 * Marking a resource obsolete is future work, and it will be a mark rather than a drop.
 *
 * <p><b>Idempotent by construction, because it is called on every deployment.</b> The caller does
 * not know what the server holds — the registry row and {@code pg_catalog} drift apart in both
 * directions, a reset postgres volume one way and a restored deployer database the other — so this
 * is handed both candidate passwords and answers which one is now in effect.

   * reset, and the only way back is to rotate the role to the fresh value; a row that exists while
   * the role does not is a postgres volume that was reset, and the way back is to recreate the role
   * with the stored value so every running container keeps working.
