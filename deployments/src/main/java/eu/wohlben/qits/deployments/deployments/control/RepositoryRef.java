/**
 * Which repository a green build came from, in <b>both</b> coordinate systems the platform now has.
 *
 * <p>qits-githost is dumb blob storage: its repository key is an opaque UUID and {@code
 * /git/<uuid>} is an internal URL only qits-projects speaks. The public identity is {@code
 * (projectId, repoName)}, and that is what every announcement above the storage seam carries. This
 * record is the pair, travelling together from the intake down to the one place that needs the
 * address (the spec read) — so nothing below has to guess which of the two a bare string was.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link #applicationName()} is the invariant this whole component turns on.</b> The
 * application name drives the image tag {@code qits/<name>:<sha>}, the network alias, the container
 * name, the provisioned database and role names, and the GC keep-set — and every pipeline yml
 * pushes its image as a literal {@code qits/<name>}. An application name that became a storage UUID
 * would send every deployment to {@code IMAGE_MISSING} and would make the orchestrator's garbage
 * collector delete the images that are live. So the name wins whenever the event carries one.
 *
 * <p><b>An absent name falls back to the repository id, and that is compatibility rather than a
 * guess.</b> Before the identity rollback the storage id <em>was</em> the name, so an event with no
 * name fields is an older publisher and the id is the right answer; after it, qits-ci fills both on
 * every build event. A mirror-sync push on the internal id route announces without names on
 * purpose, and its deployment — if any tier listened — is the pre-cutover behaviour byte for byte.
