/**
 * The health gate's semantics, apart from the runtime calls that feed it: read a service's state
 * and say whether it is healthy — and, for a caller that has to wait for one itself, poll until it
 * is healthy, until the deadline, or until it is gone.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link #await} has no caller left</b>, and knowing why saves the next reader a search: it
 * was the docker path's cutover, which polled a fresh container itself. Swarm reaches its own
 * verdict ({@code UpdateStatus}), so the seam asks {@code awaitConverged} instead. What the
 * component still reads is {@link Poll} and {@link #healthy} — {@link DeploymentObserver} settles a
 * row on exactly that reading. The loop is kept because the patience below is a decision worth not
 * re-deriving, not because something needs it today.
 *
 * <p><b>Everything short of healthy is PENDING, and that is the whole of this class.</b> The gate
 * used to end the moment docker reported anything other than {@code running/…}: a {@code
 * restarting} container failed the deployment instantly, and so did a {@code running/unhealthy}
 * one. That was right while every application carried its store in-process and a container that
 * had already died was never coming back. It stopped being right when the platform moved onto
 * PostgreSQL. A container starts on its primary network only — {@code docker run} takes exactly one
 * — and the joins that make the postgres alias resolve happen after the start, so a PG-backed
 * application runs Flyway before its database has an address, dies with an acquisition timeout, and
 * is restarted seconds later by its {@code unless-stopped} policy into a world where the networks
 * are joined. The second boot succeeds. The old gate never saw it: it read {@code
 * restarting/unhealthy} once and failed a deployment that was about to work, which is what
 * qits-platform-idp's first PostgreSQL deployment did 18 seconds in.
 *
 * <p>So the only two verdicts that end the gate early are <b>healthy</b> and <b>gone</b>. Gone is a
 * container docker cannot inspect at all — removed underneath the deployment — and there is nothing
 * to wait for. Everything else is the deadline's to decide, and the deadline is the caller's
 * ({@code qits.deployments.health-timeout-seconds}); this change does not extend it by a
 * second, it only stops spending it early.
 *
 * <p><b>The race itself is gone with the path.</b> A swarm service declares its whole membership
 * when it is created, so a first boot never runs before its peers are addressable. The patience
 * survives it: the same states are read one at a time by the observer, and a container that is
 * restarting or answering its probe with a failure is still not a dead deployment.
