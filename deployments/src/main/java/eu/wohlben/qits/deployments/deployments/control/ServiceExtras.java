/**
 * What one application needs beyond its image — mounts, published ports, extra groups, extra
 * environment — as deployment config states it, and as a driver reads it.
 *
 * <p><b>This is the contract, and it is structured rather than free-form.</b> It
 * replaces {@code qits.deployments.run-args.<application>}, a free-form {@code docker run}
 * argv that was whitespace split and appended verbatim. That was justified by "the argv is docker's
 * vocabulary"; it stopped being true the moment a service create had to render the same intent —
 * {@code -v} is {@code --mount}, {@code --group-add} is {@code --group}, and a publish is a
 * different word again. Translating one orchestrator's argv into another's is guessing at intent
 * from a spelling. So config states the intent and <b>each driver renders it</b>.
 *
 * <h2>The grammar</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 * qits.deployments.extras.&lt;application&gt;.mounts[&lt;i&gt;]    = volume:&lt;name&gt;:&lt;target&gt;[:ro]
 *                                                                 | bind:&lt;host-path&gt;:&lt;target&gt;[:ro]
 * qits.deployments.extras.&lt;application&gt;.publishes[&lt;i&gt;] = [&lt;ip&gt;:]&lt;host-port&gt;:&lt;port&gt;[/tcp|/udp]
 * qits.deployments.extras.&lt;application&gt;.groups[&lt;i&gt;]    = &lt;gid&gt;
 * qits.deployments.extras.&lt;application&gt;.aliases[&lt;i&gt;]   = &lt;dns-name&gt;
 * qits.deployments.extras.&lt;application&gt;.env.&lt;KEY&gt;      = &lt;value&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The index orders a list and means nothing else. Environment is keyed by the variable instead,
 * because a variable is named once by definition — and because a generated file that renumbers
 * twenty entries to add one is a file nobody edits safely.
 *
 * <p><b>An alias is a second DNS name for this application on the shared network</b>, and it exists
 * because the edge proxy answers for vhost names ({@code registry.dev.localhost} and its siblings)
 * that docker's embedded DNS cannot synthesize: a container asking for one gets NXDOMAIN unless the
 * edge holds it as a network alias. It is deployment config rather than a repository's own spec for
 * the reason every other member of this family is — where a name resolves is a property of the
 * platform an application is deployed onto, not of the code.
 *
 * <p><b>An unknown or malformed key is a refused deployment, not a warning.</b> Config is typed
 * now, so garbage in it is a bug — and the failure it used to produce was the worst kind: a
 * container that boots, passes its health gate and has lost its volume. {@link Refused} carries the
 * key and what is wrong with it into the deployment's {@code detail}.
 *
 * <p><b>Only the deployed application's own keys are ever read</b>, which is the security property
 * the free-form family had and this one keeps: one application's socket bind cannot ride along on a
 * sibling's deployment. It is the reason the <b>dotted spelling is the only one</b> — {@code
 * QITS_PLATFORM_DEPLOYMENTS_EXTRAS_QITS_CI_ENV_X} cannot be told apart from a key of {@code
 * qits-ci-daemon}, because both a dash and a dot become an underscore. Deployment config reaches
 * this component as a properties file on its config volume, where the dot is a dot.
 *
 * <p>Nothing arriving over HTTP contributes here. Deployment config is the trust domain that
 * already holds the docker socket, and it is the only source.
