/**
 * Deployment config as it reads NOW, for one argv.
 *
 * <p><b>The boot Config is a snapshot and it goes stale.</b> Deployment config reaches this
 * component as a properties file on its config volume, and Quarkus' config-dir convention reads
 * {@code <user.dir>/config/application.properties} exactly once, at boot. So an edit on that volume
 * changed nothing until the process was replaced — and worse, every deployment re-stamped the boot
 * snapshot onto the service it updated, so a live fix applied with {@code service update --env-add}
 * was reverted by the next deployment of any application. That happened, on 2026-08-16, and it cost
 * a day.
 *
 * <p><b>So the file is re-read per argv build</b> and layered over the boot config: it outranks
 * every source the boot config carries (system properties are 400, the environment 300), and the
 * boot config answers everything the file does not state. Edit the file, and the next deployment
 * carries it.
 *
 * <p><b>One snapshot per argv build, and that is the invariant {@link ServiceExtras} rests on.</b>
 * Its javadoc says every reading agrees, which is only true of a fixed {@link Config}: the file is
 * read into a map here, so a snapshot answers the same thing however often it is asked and however
 * the file changes under it. A caller takes one and hands it to every reading of one deployment.
 *
 * <p><b>An absent file is the boot config itself</b>, byte for byte the behaviour a dev run and the
 * clone-alone suite always had — neither has such a file.
 *
 * <p><b>A file that is there and cannot be read REFUSES the deployment</b>, naming the path. Falling
 * back to the boot values would be the stale value this class exists to kill, and it would be
 * invisible: the deployment goes green carrying whatever the process booted with.
 *
 * <p><b>There is a second shape where a platform runs qits-configuration</b> — {@link #over(Config,
 * Map, String)}, the properties that service resolved for this application, over the boot config
 * and with <b>no file under them at all</b>. Which layers exist is {@code
 * DeploymentExtrasSource}'s decision; this class only states the order.
