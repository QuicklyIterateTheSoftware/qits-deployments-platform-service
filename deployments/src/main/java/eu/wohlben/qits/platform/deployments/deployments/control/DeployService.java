/**
 * The deployment orchestrator: a build-succeeded event → the repository's deployment spec at that
 * commit → the environments that spec addresses → one recorded deployment each, driven pull → run →
 * join → health gate → cutover on a single-threaded daemon worker (the intake returns immediately;
 * deployments across all environments are serialized — parallelism is an explicit follow-up, and
 * serial is what makes "the previous ACTIVE deployment" an uncontended read).
 *
 * <p><b>Registration is derived, and it is a local write.</b> Nothing declares an application over
 * the API. A green build carries this component to {@code .config/qits/deployments.yml} in the
 * repository at that sha, and the service row is created or brought up to date from it: an {@code
 * environment} target is linked into every environment whose branch matches, a {@code platform}
 * target keeps no links at all and deploys once for the whole platform. Both planes answer the same
 * branch question — does an environment listen to this ref — so {@code environment/<name>} is the
 * only deploy ref the platform has. A repository with no such file gets the defaults and behaves
 * exactly as it did before the file existed.
 *
 * <p><b>This is what the merge bought.</b> Registration and resolution used to be HTTP calls onto
 * qits-serviceregistry: a port, a {@code java.net.http} implementation, a stub server in the suite,
 * a bearer to mint, and a whole recorded-FAILED posture for the case where the peer was down —
 * because a deployer that cannot ask where a build belongs must never guess a topology. All of it
 * is gone. Registration writes rows in the same transaction as everything else here, resolution is
 * a repository query with an index behind it, and there is no outage to have a posture about. The
 * one remote call left is the spec read, and its posture stays exactly as it was.
 *
 * <p><b>The worker carries one thing that is not an event</b>: the periodic observation pass ({@link
 * DeploymentObserver}), enqueued by a ticker here and running in queue order like everything else.
 * That is the whole reason it may touch deployment rows at all — see {@link #enqueueObservation()}.
 *
 * <p>Each DB transition sits in its own {@link QuarkusTransaction#requiringNew()} bracket so the
 * slow docker work never holds a transaction, and everything the docker calls need is copied into a
 * plain {@link Plan} first — the worker thread has no request context and no open session.
 *
 * <p><b>Three of those brackets are wrapped in {@link DbRetry}</b> — the platform's, from
 * qits-db-core — because this component deploys the postgres its own registry lives in and a cutover
 * of qits-oci-postgresql kills the connections of the very deployment performing it: the catalogue
 * read an event opens with, the post-gate cutover bookkeeping, and {@link #finish}. Connection-class
 * failures only, and {@link #CUTOVER_BUDGET} only — the rest of the brackets are deliberately left
 * alone, and {@link #queue} says why.
 *
 * <p><b>Which of the two spellings each one takes is decided by who owns the transaction.</b> The
 * catalogue read is a {@link DbRetry#call} around a read that brackets itself; the two writes are
 * {@link DbRetry#inNewTx}, which <i>is</i> the {@code requiringNew} — the retry owning the boundary
 * is what lets it retry only attempts that certainly did not commit, and leaves the one undecidable
 * round trip (the commit acknowledgement) reported rather than repeated.
 *
 * <p><b>The cutover is the DRIVER's, and that is the shape this class settled into.</b> What is
 * left here is one path with no branches in it: resolve the target, provision what the repository
 * declared, pull so a missing image is its own outcome, {@link DeploymentDriver#apply} the spec,
 * {@link DeploymentDriver#awaitConverged wait for the verdict}, record it. A predecessor search, a
 * stop-before-start and a hand-rolled rollback used to sit in the middle of that, and each was a
 * statement about how one orchestrator replaces a container rather than about deploying. Nothing
 * about the sequence above is orchestrator-shaped, which is the test that it is in the right place.
 *
 * <p><b>What stayed is the bookkeeping</b>: the row per place, the four announcements, the cutover
 * bracket that decommissions the prior {@code ACTIVE} rows of an (application, tier) and marks this
 * one live, and the reap that follows it — rows first, services after, so a bracket that has to
 * retry for thirty seconds has not already removed the predecessor.
 *
 * <p><b>One outcome is neither success nor failure and is worth knowing about here</b>: a
 * deployment that replaces THIS process comes back {@link DeploymentDriver.ApplyOutcome#HANDED_OFF
 * HANDED_OFF}, and the row is deliberately left {@code STARTING}. Neither instance can arbitrate
 * its own succession, so the outcome is recorded by whichever survives: the next boot's {@link
 * #sweepInFlight() sweep} settles the row from the image the service is running.

   * and the one application that reaches {@code ACTIVE} through this sweep every single time is
   * <b>this one</b>, whose self-update is handed to the orchestrator and never announces from {@link
   * #execute}. That cost it its own route and its own navigation entry: the deployer's UI was
   * unreachable and absent from the menu on every platform, while every other application announced
   * normally. {@link DeploymentObserver}'s later corrections still announce nothing — a demotion and
   * a recovery restate an outcome hours later and a consumer would have to know the second statement

   *
   * <p><b>It announces from the ROW and reaches no peer</b> — V3's routing columns, written at queue
   * time — because this runs at boot and the boot in question is the one right after a cutover. See
   * {@link #announceAdopted}; and a snapshot that cannot be established announces <b>nothing</b>
   * rather than an empty one, because consumers replace rather than merge and an empty snapshot
   * deletes the routes it could not describe.
   *
   * <p>The shape is the observation pass's: read the rows in one transaction, ask the runtime
   * outside every one of them — a driver call is a child process, and no bracket of this
   * component's own may span one — then write each row in a bracket of its own. The announcement

   * applied to the rows instead of the containers. ({@code ServiceCatalog.upsert} is synchronized
   * as the belt for every other caller.)
   *
   * <p>{@code runId} is optional and is recorded on every row this queues, verbatim: it is the only
   * pointer from a deployment back to the build that caused it, and it is resolved against nothing
   * — a reader takes it to qits-ci. The triple that actually drives the deployment is (repository,
   * branch, commitSha).
   *
   * <p><b>This is where the REPOSITORY's name is settled, once and for the whole event.</b> The
   * repository arrives in two coordinate systems — an opaque storage id, and the public {@code
   * (projectId, repoName)} pair when the announcement carried one — and {@link
   * RepositoryRef#applicationName()} picks the name over the id. Everything below takes that string
   * by value: the catalogue key, the {@link Target}, the health path, the provisioned database and
   * role, the wire alias, the container name and the image reference. Only the spec read still
   * needs the reference itself, because the git host addresses a blob by either coordinate. Passing
   * a repository id where a name is meant is the regression to watch for — it would tag images
   * {@code qits/<uuid>:<sha>} while every pipeline pushes {@code qits/<name>:<sha>}.
   *
   * <p><b>The APPLICATION name is settled one step later</b>, in {@link #deploy}, because a
   * repository may declare {@code application:} in the file this has not read yet. Absent — every
   * file today — the two are the same string and this paragraph describes both.
   *
   * <p><b>{@code causationId} is carried by value from here on, and that is the whole reason it is
   * a parameter.</b> {@code CausationScope} is a ThreadLocal: the door's scope — the frame's for the
   * bus, the request filter's restored one for the HTTP intake — stands on THIS thread and is gone

   *
   * <p>There is no "this name already belongs to another repository" check, and there is nothing to

   * which is what keeps a push to the integration trunk from shipping the platform.
   *
   * <p>Where the two arms differ is <b>which</b> environment counts. The environment arm fans out
   * over every tier listening to the branch; this one deploys only when the <b>platform
   * environment</b> is among them. What it deploys is one instance with no environment id and no
   * links, so "every tier's branch rolls it" was never a fan-out — it was several tiers taking turns
