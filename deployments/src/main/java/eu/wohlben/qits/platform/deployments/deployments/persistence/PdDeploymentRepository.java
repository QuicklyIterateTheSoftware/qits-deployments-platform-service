/**
 * Panache DAO for {@link PdDeployment}.

 * createdAt desc, id desc}. The id is a random UUID, so the older tiebreak swapped two rows
 * recorded in the same tick at random, which is exactly what the deployments of one
 * build-succeeded event are.
 *
 * <p>Where a tier is matched, {@code null} is tested as a value rather than compared: a platform
 * deployment belongs to no tier, and {@code environment_id = null} matches nothing at all in SQL.
 * The startup sweep's adoption of a self-update row hangs on getting that right.
