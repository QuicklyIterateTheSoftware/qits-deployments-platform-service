/**
 * The deployment wire shape. Hand-written rather than a MapStruct interface for one reason: {@code
 * applicationId} is not a column. It is derived from the row's {@code (environmentId,
 * applicationName)} pair through {@link ApplicationKeys}, which is the same definition the
 * applications listing derives its own id from — that shared derivation is what lets a client keep
 * joining the two listings when neither side has a row to take an id from.
