/**
 * The deployment wire shape. Hand-written rather than a MapStruct interface for one reason: {@code
 * applicationId} is not a column. It is derived from the row's {@code (environmentId,
 * applicationName)} through {@link ApplicationKeys}, which is the same definition the applications
 * listing derives its own id from — that shared derivation is what lets a client keep joining the
 * two listings when neither side has a row to take an id from.
 *
 * <p><b>The plane came out of the key with the plane itself.</b> It was there because the two sides
 * of the join disagreed about the tier — a platform deployment named one and the catalogue row it
 * joined to carried no link — and now both sides read the tier off the same links. A client that
 * cached a {@code platform:<name>} id across the change fails to join, which is the cutover this
 * key pays for once.

   * for one, and inventing {@code platform:} or {@code <tier>:} from the tier alone is exactly the
   * silent mis-join this class's header describes. The name is the join key, and {@link
   * eu.wohlben.qits.platform.deployments.deployments.dto.PdDeploymentRequestDto} says so.
   *
   * <p><b>The deployment is a parameter and is nullable, and both halves of that are the point.</b>
   * A request the gate refused points at nothing, so there is no row to take a status from and the
   * field is null — the honest answer, and one a client reads as "nothing ran" rather than as "not
   * yet". And the row arrives as an argument rather than being fetched here, because every caller is
   * mapping a LIST: the join is one batch query at the caller, and a mapper that loaded per row
   * would turn a listing into a query per line.
   *
   * @param deployment the deployment {@code request.deploymentId} names, or {@code null}
