/**
 * The seam between this component's orchestration and whatever runs the containers — the {@code
 * CiStepRunner} arrangement: this module owns the interface and the state machine that calls it,
 * {@code service/} owns the implementations, and the suites install a scripted fake so a clone's
 * {@code mvn verify} needs no docker.
 *
 * <p><b>A second orchestrator is what reshaped this interface, and only one is left.</b> It used
 * to be docker's own vocabulary written out: {@code start} one container, {@code stop} and {@code
 * restart} the predecessors, {@code connect} each network after the fact, and a caller in {@link
 * DeployService} that sequenced all of it. Every one of those verbs is a statement about how one
 * orchestrator replaces a container rather than about deploying, so keeping them would have made
 * that model look like the contract. They went, the by-hand path went after them, and the shape
 * they left is the one worth keeping: a driver states outcomes, never mechanics.
 *
 * <p><b>So the seam is now two verbs and the rest is bookkeeping</b>: {@link #apply(ServiceSpec)}
 * makes the described service exist at the described image, and {@link #awaitConverged} says
 * whether it took. How that happens — stop-then-start with a hand-rolled rollback, or {@code
 * service update --update-order start-first --update-failure-action rollback} — is the
 * implementation's business, and the whole of the difference between the two lives there.
 *
 * <p>Everything crossing this seam is ids, names and references — never entities. The driver knows
 * nothing about environments or deployments; it applies a spec, watches it converge, and makes and
 * removes networks.
 *
 * <p><b>Docker is the membership bookkeeping.</b> Which service sits on which
 * network is never stored in this component's database — it is read back from the labels below.
 * One record of the truth, and it is the runtime's, so a row cannot describe a topology the
 * runtime does not have.
 *
 * <p><b>The labels are {@code qits.platform.deployments.*}, and every earlier spelling is a
 * legacy.</b> {@code qits.cd.*} came from the retired ancestor and {@code qits.pd.*} from this
 * component before the namespace was written out in full; containers and networks carrying either
 * are treated exactly like unlabelled ones — adoptable predecessors, never protected — because that
 * is what makes each cutover a deployment rather than a flag day. Nothing here reads a legacy
 * label, and nothing should start to: the absence of a {@code qits.platform.deployments.*} label is
 * already the whole statement.
