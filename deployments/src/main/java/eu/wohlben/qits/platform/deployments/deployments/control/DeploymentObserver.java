/**
 * The second half of the eaa34fbc story. A deployment's status is written once, by the deployment
 * that earned it, and until this class existed it was never read back against the world: row
 * eaa34fbc ended {@code FAILED: [unexpected: JDBCConnectionException …]} because the post-gate
 * bookkeeping ran on connections its own cutover of qits-oci-postgresql had just killed, while the
 * container it started stayed {@code Up (healthy)} for hours holding the application's alias.
 * {@link DbRetry} fixed the CAUSE; a row that ended {@code FAILED} still stays {@code FAILED}
 * forever, and the mirror image — an {@code ACTIVE} row whose container died an hour after the gate
 * passed — was never noticed at all.
 *
 * <p>So this is a periodic observation, not a second deploy path. <b>It writes rows only.</b> It
 * reaps no container, starts no container and touches no network — the startup sweep's "deliberately
 * reaps no containers" stance, which applies here more strongly than there: the sweep at least runs
 * once, at a moment nothing else is happening, while this runs beside a live platform forever.
 *
 * <p><b>It settles the LATEST row per (application, tier) and nothing else.</b> Latest by {@code
 * seq}, the documented ordering — {@code createdAt} is not unique and the id is a random UUID.
 * History stays history: an older {@code FAILED} row describes an attempt that really did fail, and
 * a healthy container today says nothing about it. {@code QUEUED} and {@code STARTING} belong to the
 * worker's own state machine (the intake queued them, the sweep fails them after a crash) and
 * {@code DECOMMISSIONED} is a decision another deployment made; none of the three is observable from
 * a container's state.
 *
 * <p><b>Three transitions, and each is deliberately narrow.</b>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code FAILED}, {@code GONE} or {@code SCALED_TO_ZERO} → {@code ACTIVE} when the container
 *       <b>the row itself names</b> exists, runs
 *       and is healthy by {@link HealthGate#healthy} — the gate's own verdict, so a recovery cannot
 *       mean something a health gate would have refused. Only the row's own container counts: a
 *       healthy container of some other deployment must never resurrect a foreign row, which is why
 *       this asks docker about {@code containerName} rather than about the alias.
 *   <li>{@code ACTIVE} → {@code GONE} when the container is <b>absent or terminally exited</b> on
 *       {@value #STRIKES_TO_DEMOTE} consecutive passes. Patience is inherited from the health gate
 *       rather than reinvented: <b>restarting is not dead</b> and <b>running-but-unhealthy is not
 *       dead</b> — that is the postgres-alias boot race the gate already tolerates, and a container
 *       coming back from it must not be declared failed on the way. The second pass is the belt for
 *       a docker hiccup: one {@code inspect} that could not answer must never flip a deployment that
 *       is serving.
 *   <li>{@code ACTIVE} → {@code SCALED_TO_ZERO} when the place is empty and the orchestrator says it
 *       is <b>declared</b> empty — {@link DeploymentDriver#desiredReplicas}. This one takes no
 *       strikes and needs none: it is not a guess about a container that might come back, it is the
 *       intent read off the runtime that holds it.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The third arm is what keeps this class from fighting an operator</b>, and it is the reason
 * it was added at all. An application scaled to zero — through {@code ApplicationScaling}, or by
 * hand with {@code docker service scale} — runs no task, so every reading here says "gone": without
 * the desired count this pass would demote the row two ticks after somebody deliberately stopped
 * the application, report an outage that is not one, and then keep saying so for as long as the
 * pause lasted. The count is asked <b>only of a candidate that already looks dead</b>, so a healthy
 * platform pays nothing for it.
 *
 * <p><b>A recovery also retires the predecessors it never got to retire.</b> The bookkeeping that
 * died in eaa34fbc was one bracket doing two things — decommission the prior {@code ACTIVE} rows of
 * this (application, tier) and mark this one {@code ACTIVE} — so a row recovered here may well have
 * an older row still claiming to serve. Leaving it would break the invariant {@code
 * PdDeploymentRepository#listActiveByApplication} is written around (at most one ACTIVE per place),
 * and the rollback pins read off it. Their containers are NOT removed, exactly as the sweep does not
 * remove them: whatever still holds the alias is absorbed as a predecessor by the next deployment.
 *
 * <p>The pass runs <b>on the deploy worker</b> ({@code pd-deploy-worker}), enqueued by {@link
 * DeployService}, which is the whole reason it can read these rows at all without racing a cutover —
 * see that class for the collapse rule. Its own shape follows the worker's: read the candidates in
 * one transaction, copy them out as plain values, ask docker outside any transaction, then write each
 * settled row in its own bracket. Every one of those brackets is a {@link DbRetry#inNewTx} — the
 * retry owns the transaction, so it retries only attempts that certainly did not commit. Retried for
 * the same reason the cutover bookkeeping is: this is bookkeeping that runs <i>after</i> a container
 * is running, and one day it will run during a postgres self-cutover.
