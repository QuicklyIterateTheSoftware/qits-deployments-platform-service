/**
 * Is this release still the newest version of its application?
 *
 * <p><b>Why the question exists at all.</b> The manual door is a live POST: what arrives is what
 * just happened. The bus is not. A durable consumer is caught up from qits-events' log after a
 * disconnect, a restart or a cutover, so it can be handed a release that was cut <em>before</em>
 * one it has already deployed — and a handler that simply applied whatever arrived would, one
 * restart later, roll an older version over a newer one. The library says so in {@code
 * QitsDurableEventListener}'s javadoc: collapsing to the tip is the consumer's job, because only
 * the consumer knows which of its effects commute.
 *
 * <p>This is not about duplicates. The same event arriving twice is impossible — the library claims
 * each {@code (listener, event id)} pair exactly once. This is about <b>different, older</b> events.
 *
 * <p>It is the ancestor {@code BuildTips} re-derived for versions, and the derivation changed two
 * things:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The measure is the VERSION, not a timestamp.</b> A build was ordered by when it
 *       finished, because two commits carry no order at all. A release carries its own order in its
 *       name: the CalVer stamp is monotonic per application, so "is this newer" is a comparison
 *       between the two values themselves rather than between the clock readings of the events that
 *       announced them. That is strictly better — a replayed event whose envelope timestamp was
 *       rewritten still cannot claim to be a version it is not. Compared by {@link Versions},
 *       because the stamp is unpadded and lexical order gets it wrong (see that class).
 *   <li><b>The branch is gone.</b> A build was the tip of a {@code (repository, branch)}; a release
 *       is the tip of an APPLICATION. There are no branch-scoped release lines, and the tiers a
 *       version lands in are no longer chosen by a branch either.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>What "the tip" is measured against, and why it takes two answers</h2>
 *
 * <p>The floor is the newest version this component already accepted for that application, and
 * there are two ways to know it, each covering what the other cannot:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>What this process announced</b>, remembered in a map. Exact, and what makes two releases
 *       seconds apart both deploy, in order.
 *   <li><b>The newest deployment REQUEST row</b> for that application, consulted only when the map
 *       has nothing. That is the cross-restart floor: a process that has just booted remembers
 *       nothing, and a catch-up sweep at startup is precisely when a stale event arrives.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The request row rather than the deployment row, and that is the one place this improves on its
 * ancestor rather than translating it. A request is written the moment a release is accepted for a
 * place — before the pull, before the health gate, before any terminal word — so it records "this
 * version was asked for here" even when the deployment then failed. {@code BuildTips} had to read a
 * deployment row instead, which is stamped minutes later and is why it needed a paragraph about
 * comparing a build's finish time against a row's write time. There is no such skew here: both
 * sides of this comparison are version strings.
 *
 * <p><b>The residual, stated rather than hidden.</b> A release accepted for NO place — an
 * application nothing is registered for, a platform with no tier designated — writes no request
 * row, so a restart between that release and its successor loses the floor and a stale catch-up can
 * pass. It costs nothing: there was nowhere to deploy it either way.
 *
 * <p>The manual door writes nothing here and is deliberately not guarded by it: an operator posting
 * a version is choosing that version, including when the choice is a rollback.
