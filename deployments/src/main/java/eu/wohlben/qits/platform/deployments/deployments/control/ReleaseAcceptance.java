/**
 * <b>The acceptance ledger.</b> What this component has taken responsibility for deploying, and
 * whether it has finished.
 *
 * <h2>The hole this fills, which is not the one the bus already fills</h2>
 *
 * <p>qits-eventstream makes the door durable: a {@code SoftwareRelease} broadcast while this
 * component is down is read back out of qits-events' log by the catch-up sweep and handed to the
 * subscriber exactly once, and the claim in {@code consumed_event} commits with the handler. That
 * guarantee ends where the handler returns — and {@link ReleaseAnnouncements#announce} returns as
 * soon as the release is a {@code Runnable} on {@code pd-deploy-worker}. The queue is in memory,
 * deployments are serialized platform-wide so it is legitimately an hour deep, and {@code
 * DeployService}'s {@code @PreDestroy} calls {@code shutdownNow()} on it.
 *
 * <p>So a cutover of this component — which it performs on itself, {@code stop-first} — used to drop
 * every release in that queue while the bus's ledger said, correctly, that the event had been
 * handled. The successor's sweep found the claim, skipped the event, and no deployment request was
 * ever written. Seven applications' releases went that way on 2026-09-05; four were replayed by hand
 * and three were rescued only because a later release folded their tags.
 *
 * <h2>Why a second ledger rather than a longer transaction</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because there cannot be a longer transaction. {@code consumed_event} is in the {@code
 * eventstream} database and these rows are in {@code platformdeployments}; both datasources are
 * non-XA and Narayana refuses two of them in one transaction — the note {@link ReleaseTips} already
 * carries for its floor read. The claim and the obligation cannot commit together, so the ORDER is
 * chosen instead: <b>the obligation is written first, before anything is queued</b>. What that
 * leaves is a duplicate (obligation written, claim rolled back), never a loss — and a duplicate is
 * exactly what the re-drive guards in {@link OwedReleaseSweep} collapse.
 *
 * <h2>{@link #instanceId()}, which is the whole re-drive predicate</h2>
 *
 * <p>A uuid minted once per JVM. A row carrying it is on this process's worker queue and must not be
 * re-driven however long it sits there; a row carrying anybody else's belonged to a queue that did
 * not survive its JVM and is orphaned by definition. A time-based predicate cannot do this job: any
 * grace period longer than a legitimate hour-deep queue is longer than the outage it would be
 * covering.
 *
 * <p>An instance field rather than a static one, deliberately: {@code service/} compiles to a
 * GraalVM native image, and a static initializer is evaluated at build time and baked into the image
 * heap — every container of one image would then share one "process" id and no row would ever look
 * orphaned. An {@code @ApplicationScoped} bean is instantiated at runtime, so this is.
 *
 * <p>Every bracket here is a {@link DbRetry} in a transaction of its own. The callers are the bus
 * door (inside the library's claim transaction, which has the other datasource enlisted and must be
 * suspended) and the sweep's daemon thread (which has no transaction at all), and this component
 * deploys the postgres it is writing to.

   * public address that no longer resolves, and the release becomes a sixty-minute {@code
   * SPEC_UNREADABLE} hold at a URL nothing serves. The id-route fallback does not rescue it:
   * qits-githost refuses {@code /git/<repoId>} to every caller that is not qits-projects, and a 403
   * is classified retryable.
   *
   * <p><b>{@code project_id} is filled and never overwritten</b>, and the asymmetry is the whole of
   * it. {@link RepositoryRef#nameAddressed()} needs BOTH halves, so a row carrying a name and no
   * project still falls back to the refused id route and is worth completing. But a rename is not a
   * MOVE — qits-projects renames within a project and says so in the event — so a row already naming
   * a <em>different</em> project is not this event's to correct, and rewriting it would be this
   * component inventing a repository's ownership from an event that never claimed to state one.
   *
   * <p><b>Every row of that repository moves, the settled ones included</b>, and that is deliberate
   * rather than lazy. The column is the address the spec is read at, not a record of what the
   * repository was called when the release was accepted — an address that no longer resolves is
   * worth nothing as history, and the settled {@code EXHAUSTED} row is precisely the one a person
   * opens when they go looking for why a release never deployed. What identity this component really
   * does record — the application name, the version — lives on {@code pd_deployment_request} and
   * {@code pd_deployment} and is untouched by any of this: an application name is not a repository
   * name, which is the whole reason {@code application:} exists in the spec.
   *
   * <p>In a {@link DbRetry} transaction of its own like every other bracket here, and for a sharper
   * reason than the siblings: the caller is the bus door, inside the library's claim transaction on
   * the {@code eventstream} datasource, and Narayana refuses two non-XA resources in one
   * transaction. There is no {@code flush()} at the end, and that is the rule being satisfied rather
   * than skipped — {@code executeUpdate} issues the statement itself, so nothing of this write is
   * pending at commit, which is exactly the state the flush exists to produce for an ORM write.
