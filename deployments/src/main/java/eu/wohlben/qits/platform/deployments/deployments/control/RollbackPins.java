/**
 * Which image tags are rollback-relevant right now: per application, the tag it is serving and the
 * tag a rollback would put back.
 *
 * <p><b>A tag is a released VERSION now</b> ({@code 2026.903.113443}), because that is what a
 * deployment pulls — {@code qits/<application>:<version>}. It is read through {@link
 * PdDeployment#imageTag()}, so a row written before releases became the trigger still pins the sha
 * its image really carries. The wire field is still called {@code shas} and must stay so: it is
 * qits-artifacts' garbage collector's parse key, the match against a tag is a plain string
 * equality, and renaming the field would abort every sweep on the platform (that reader is
 * fail-closed). The values inside it changed; the contract did not.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> qits-artifacts' OCI garbage collector deletes an image tag only when no
 * pin names it, and this component is the only thing that knows what is running. The policy lives
 * <em>here</em>, beside {@link DeployService} — the code that performs the rollback — so the GC's
 * keep-set and the rollback target cannot drift: one definition, read by both. A keep-set computed
 * in the service that deletes rather than in the service that deploys is two definitions, and the
 * day they disagree the GC deletes the image a restart is about to pull.
 *
 * <p><b>The anchor to the real rollback.</b> {@link DeployService} decommissions the previously
 * {@code ACTIVE} row only when a fresh deployment passes its health gate, and a failed gate
 * <em>restarts</em> what the cutover stopped — leaving the previous deployment {@code ACTIVE} and
 * serving. So the deployment a rollback puts back is always the newest row that actually served:
 * {@code ACTIVE} now, or {@code DECOMMISSIONED} because a successor replaced it. That row's sha is
 * the second pin, and it is the sha a rollback pulls again.
 *
 * <p>The rules, each of which a case in {@code RollbackPinsTest} holds:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Per application row group, the serving sha.</b> The newest {@code ACTIVE} row's sha — the
 *       reference the container was created from, and the one a docker restart pulls again. An
 *       application with no {@code ACTIVE} row is serving nothing, so it pins nothing.
 *   <li><b>Then the previous <em>distinct</em> sha.</b> A redeploy of the same commit writes a
 *       second row at the same sha; reading that as the previous version would pin a duplicate of
 *       what is already running and drop the only thing a rollback could pull.
 *   <li><b>One rollback step, not the whole history.</b> Keeping every sha a row ever named
 *       reclaims nothing.
 *   <li><b>A row that is not serving is not a rollback target.</b> Every status but {@code ACTIVE}
 *       and {@code DECOMMISSIONED} is skipped rather than ending the search: an attempt that never
 *       passed a health gate is not a version to go back to, and going back to it is not what
 *       {@link DeployService} does.
 *       <p>The refined failure vocabulary changes nothing here, and that is worth stating because
 *       one of the words looks like it should. {@code ROLLED_BACK} and {@code SUPERSEDED} never
 *       served, exactly as the {@code FAILED} they used to be spelled as. {@code GONE} <em>did</em>
 *       serve — and is still skipped, because a pin keeps an image the platform can go back to and
 *       a row whose container is confirmed absent has nothing left to go back to. It was excluded
 *       as {@code FAILED} before the word existed, so naming it did not move the answer.
 *   <li><b>Per application <em>name</em>, across every environment.</b> One service in two
 *       environments is two histories sharing one image name, since every pull is {@code
 *       <repository>/<name>:<sha>} ({@link ImageRefs}). Both tiers' shas pin that image; naming one
 *       tier would leave the other's next restart with no image.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Ordering is deterministic and the shas are a set, not a sequence.</b> Pins come sorted by
 * application name; within one, the serving shas sorted, then the rollback shas sorted, each sha
 * once. A union over environments has no "most recent" to order by, so a reader must treat the list
 * as a set of shas to keep.
