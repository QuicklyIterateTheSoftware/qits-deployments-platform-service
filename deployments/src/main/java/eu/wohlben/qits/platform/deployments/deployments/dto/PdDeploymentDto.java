/**
 * One recorded deployment attempt; {@code applicationName} denormalized for legible listings.
 *
 * <p>{@code applicationId} is DERIVED from {@code (environmentId, applicationName)} — the same
 * definition the applications listing uses on its side — because a deployment row points at no
 * service row and a client joins the two listings on that id.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code version} is the released coordinate and {@code commitSha} is the commit behind it.</b>
 * The version is what the image is tagged with and what a reader identifies the deployment by; the
 * sha is the commit the released tag resolved to, and it is NULLABLE — a repository carrying no
 * deployments.yml answers the spec read with a 404, which says nothing about where the tag points.
 * On rows written before releases became the trigger it is the other way round: {@code version} is
 * null and the sha was the whole coordinate.
 *
 * <p>{@code runId} is the qits-ci run that caused this deployment, and it may be null: a {@code
 * SoftwareRelease} carries none at all, so only a manual replay supplies one. A client renders it as
 * a link to {@code /ci/runs/<runId>} when it is set and omits it when it is not; there is no other
 * way to reach the run from here.
