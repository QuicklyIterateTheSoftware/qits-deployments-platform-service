/**
 * One backing resource this component has provisioned for one application in one tier — a postgres
 * role and database on the platform's own instance, or a qits-idp service client — and the
 * credential it injects for it.
 *
 * <p><b>This row is the single authority for that credential.</b> Nothing else records it: no
 * generated file carries it, the bootstrap does not know it, and the application receives it only
 * as an environment variable at {@code docker run}. Which is what makes the registry's own database
 * credential-bearing, and what decides the two ways a mismatch is repaired — a row without a role
 * (the postgres volume was reset) is a self-heal that recreates the role with the stored password,
 * and a role without a row (this database was reset) is a reconcile that rotates it. Never a drop,
 * in either direction.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code environmentName} is a plain string with no FK, and null is the platform plane.</b>
 * The {@code pd_deployment} stance: a resource outlives the tier row that described it, because
 * nothing is ever dropped and the registry has to keep answering after a teardown. The uniqueness
 * over {@code (application, environment, resource)} is declared {@code nulls not distinct} in V1 —
 * without that, every platform-plane deployment would insert a row of its own.
 *
 * <p>{@code databaseName} and {@code roleName} are one identity for a postgres row: the role IS the
 * database name, one login per database. They are two columns so that a resource type could
 * separate them without a migration — which is exactly what {@link #clientId} is: an idp-client row
 * leaves both of them null and carries this instead, qits-idp's own key for the client. A row
 * carries only the columns its type has a fact for; the others stay null rather than holding a
 * value that means nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code @Uncaused} by decision, and the reason is what this row is.</b> It is not a record
 * of something that happened — it is the converging registry entry for a database that exists, read
 * and rewritten by every later deployment. The causation column is insert-only on purpose, so it
 * would pin this row forever to whichever deployment happened to be the first one, saying nothing
 * about the credential the row holds today. Its two writers agree: {@code ResourceProvisioning}
 * runs on {@code pd-deploy-worker}, where no scope stands and the deployment that owns the pass
 * already records the cause; and {@code BootResourceRegistration} writes at startup from the
 * environment variables a bootstrap set, with no event anywhere behind it.
