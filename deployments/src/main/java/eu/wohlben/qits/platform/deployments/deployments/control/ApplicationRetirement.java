/**
 * The operator's third lever: <b>this application is over</b>.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it exists.</b> `application:` in a repository's spec decoupled the deployed identity
 * from the repository name, and the section of AGENTS.md that introduced it says plainly what
 * happens when the value changes: "CHANGING the value later is a decommission and a new
 * application, and nothing here helps. The old name keeps its service, alias, database, rows and
 * routes." Three of them were left behind on this install — `qits-workspaces-service`,
 * `qits-projects-service` and `qits-gateway` — and each one's newest row still said {@code FAILED},
 * from an attempt made under a name nothing has deployed since. An operator reading the deployment
 * listing saw three red rows for three applications that do not exist, beside the successors that
 * were plainly serving. "Nothing here helps" is the gap this closes.
 *
 * <p><b>It writes a word, it does not delete a row.</b> {@code DECOMMISSIONED} is this component's
 * own vocabulary for "this deployment's place was taken", written by {@link DeployService} on every
 * successful cutover and by {@link DeploymentObserver} on adoption; what it says here is the same
 * thing with the successor being an application rather than a deployment. The history stays whole
 * — the failure text under the stamp is untouched, the shas, the timestamps and the run ids are
 * exactly as they were — because a deployment row is a record of an attempt and an attempt that
 * happened does not stop having happened. There is deliberately no delete on this surface: {@code
 * RollbackPins} reads history, the id a client cached still resolves, and nothing about a
 * retirement is a reason to lose an audit trail.
 *
 * <p><b>What it touches, and it is deliberately little:</b>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>the newest row of the place becomes {@code DECOMMISSIONED}</b>, because the newest row
 *       IS what the listing calls the application's current state — the whole point of the door is
 *       that the word a reader sees there is a decision somebody made rather than the residue of a
 *       build in August;
 *   <li><b>every {@code SPEC_UNREADABLE} row of the place becomes {@code DECOMMISSIONED} too</b>,
 *       which is the one word in this vocabulary that is not terminal: {@code DeployService}
 *       re-reads such a row on the observation's cadence until the file answers. A retired
 *       application's spec is never going to answer, so leaving one would be a retry that runs
 *       forever against a git address nobody maintains;
 *   <li><b>nothing else.</b> Older terminal rows keep the word they earned. A retirement is not a
 *       rewrite of what happened, and a listing that showed six identical {@code DECOMMISSIONED}
 *       rows would have destroyed exactly the history this door refuses to delete.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>It runs on the request thread, and that is the difference from {@link
 * ApplicationScaling}.</b> Both of that class's levers issue a {@code docker service update} and
 * therefore must queue behind whatever the deploy worker is cutting over; this one calls no
 * orchestrator at all. There is nothing running to act on — that is the precondition, enforced
 * below — so there is nothing a concurrent cutover could collide with, and an operator who is told
 * 200 has been told the truth rather than 202 and a promise.
 *
 * <p><b>What it refuses, and why each refusal is the safety this door needs.</b> The id names a
 * place by string; a typo names a live application just as well as a dead one. So:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code ACTIVE} or {@code SCALED_TO_ZERO} on the newest row is a <b>409</b>: something is
 *       deployed there. A serving application is retired by taking it out of its repository's spec
 *       and letting the deployment stop, not by relabelling the row that says it is up; a stopped
 *       one still has a swarm service holding its ports, its volumes and its alias, and calling it
 *       decommissioned would leave that service with nothing pointing at it.
 *   <li>{@code QUEUED} or {@code STARTING} is a <b>409</b>: the deploy worker owns those words and
 *       is about to write the next one. A row settled out from under the worker would be overwritten
 *       a second later, and the operator would never learn that their action did nothing.
 *   <li>A place nothing ever deployed is a <b>404</b>, and a malformed id a <b>400</b> — the same
 *       two answers {@link ApplicationScaling} gives, for the same reasons.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>It does not remove the catalogue row, and that is a decision.</b> {@code pd_service} is
 * derived: a green build states it, and {@code DELETE /services/{name}} is the operator's deliberate
 * act on it — a separate door with a separate argument, already shipped. Folding it in here would
 * mean this door quietly turned a retired application into one the listing labels "no longer
 * tracked", which is a worse row than the one it was asked to fix, not a better one.
