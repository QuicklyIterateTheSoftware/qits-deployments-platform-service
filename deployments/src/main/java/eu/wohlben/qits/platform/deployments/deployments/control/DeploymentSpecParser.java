 *
 * <p><b>{@code application} is what this repository deploys AS, and it decouples the deployed
 * identity from the repository's name.</b> Absent — which is every file that exists today — the
 * application name is the repository's name and every derivation is byte-identical to what it
 * always was. Present, that string IS the application name everywhere the repository's would have
 * been: the swarm service and its wire alias, the container name, the image reference {@code
 * qits/<application>:<sha>}, the provisioned database ({@code qits_} plus the name without its
 * prefix), the derived {@code host} label, the catalogue key, the extras family {@code
 * qits.platform.deployments.extras.<application>.*}, the {@code QITS_APPLICATION} the container
 * boots with, and the name every {@code Deployment*} event carries. The parser only reads and
 * validates it — the substitution happens in {@code DeployService.deploy}, which is the first place
 * that holds both the spec and the announcement it was read for.
 *
 * <p>It exists so a repository can be RENAMED without moving anything that is running: {@code
 * qits-ci} becomes the repository {@code qits-ci-service}, writes {@code application: qits-ci}, and
 * the platform does not notice. That is also why the image reference following it is a feature
 * rather than a leak — a renamed repository's pipeline keeps pushing {@code qits/qits-ci}, and the
 * deployer keeps pulling it.
 *
 * <p><b>It is validated as a stored name, not as free text</b> ({@link PdIdentifiers#requireName}):
 * lowercase letters, digits and inner dashes, at most 63 characters. Uppercase is refused outright,
 * so two spellings differing only in case cannot both exist; slashes, dots and spaces are refused
 * because this value becomes a docker service name, a DNS alias, an image path segment and half of
 * a postgres identifier.
 *
 * <p><b>Two repositories declaring one application name is LAST-WINS and this component cannot
 * refuse it.</b> {@code pd_service}, {@code pd_deployment} and {@code pd_resource} record an
 * application NAME and no repository identity at all — V1's header states that as the rule, not as
 * an omission — so there is nothing to compare a second claimant against. It is not a hazard this
 * key introduces either: two repositories in two projects may already carry one name, and they
 * already collapse the same way. What the key adds is that the claim is now written down, so every
 * deployment that takes an override logs which repository claimed which application. Refusing it
 * would take a repository identity on {@code pd_service} and a migration to hold it, which is a
 * decision about foreign identity in this schema rather than a detail of this key.
 *
 * <p><b>CHANGING an application name later is a decommission and a new application, and nothing
 * here helps with it.</b> The old name keeps its service, its alias, its database, its rows and its
 * routes; the new name gets fresh ones and deploys beside it. Editing this key on a live
 * application is that, whether or not anybody meant it — so the rename runbook moves repositories,
 * never applications.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code navigation-entries} is where an application asks to appear, and it is a list.</b>
 * One application shows up under several headings — a repository's Docs, CI and Workspaces are the
 * same three entries under all six categories — so a single label could never have said it. An
 * entry is {@code <slot>.<Label>:<position>[=<subpath>]}, read from the RIGHT: the last colon
 * separates the tail, the tail's first {@code =} separates the position from the optional subpath,
 * the last dot of what remains separates the label, and everything before it is the slot. That
 * order is what lets a label contain a colon or an equals sign ({@code services.details.CI:v2:1})
 * while the slot vocabulary stays closed. A label may not contain a dot or a comma, which is what
 * makes both separators safe.
 *
 * <p><b>What one application may claim once is a {@code (slot, label)} pair, not a slot.</b> An
 * application contributes several ROWS to one heading — {@code project.detail.Workspaces:1,
 * project.detail.Editor:2=editor} is one application asking for two entries under the project node,
 * which is exactly what a list of placements is for. Keying the claim on the slot alone refused that
 * whole file with "claims the slot `project.detail` twice", and the deployment then failed as
 * "deployment spec unreadable" while the build that produced it stayed green. The same label twice
 * in one slot stays an error: it is one row asked for twice, and no consumer can draw two of it. A
 * repeated POSITION is not an error — a number is the repository's own and a tie is broken by
 * label, which is what the document already does between applications.
 *
 * <p><b>The subpath is the view the entry opens, and it is a client-side route segment.</b> The
 * shell composes every entry's address as origin + scope + subpath ({@code
 * /<project>/services/<repo>/api-docs}), so the subpath is relative, lowercase and slash-separated
 * — never a colon, dot or comma, which is what keeps every separator above safe by construction.
 * No published-route validation touches it: it names a view of the declaring application's SPA, not
 * an edge route.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code api-docs} is where this application's browsable API document lives</b> — the
 * swagger-ui a Quarkus service serves under its non-application root — and it must sit under one of
 * the published {@code routes}, because a document nobody can reach describes nothing. It is
 * application-level metadata rather than a navigation entry: the shell's Api Docs viewer looks the
 * path up by application name and frames it. Absent is a real answer — a service that documents no
 * HTTP surface.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code host} is one DNS label, and the platform derives it when the file says nothing.</b>
 * The default is the application name without its {@code qits-platform-} or {@code qits-} prefix
 * ({@code qits-ci} → {@code ci}), resolved where the name is known — {@code DeployService}, never
 * here. A file states the key only where the public name already differs from that derivation
 * (qits-artifacts is served at {@code registry}). A host is announced only for an application that
 * asked for one: {@code host:} explicitly, or {@code navigation-entries} at all. Both keys need a
 * {@code routes} entry, because a name that leads nowhere is not a topology.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code navigation} is the retired singular, and it is accepted forever.</b> It maps to one
 * {@code system.<Label>:<position>} entry and NO host — a file that has not been rewritten yet must
 * keep behaving exactly as it did. Naming both keys is an error: they are two answers to one
 * question. See the paragraph on unknown keys below for why the word can never be taken back.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code publish_mode} is the second key an orchestrator reads rather than this
 * component.</b> {@code publish_mode: host} is today's behaviour and the default: the task binds the
 * port on the node itself. {@code ingress} gives the port to swarm's routing mesh, which keeps holding it
 * while a replacement starts — the whole reason a front door can pull its own successor's image.
 * It reaches the orchestrator as {@code mode=} on the publish, and it means nothing at all to an
 * application that publishes no port. It does <b>not</b> touch {@code update_order}: the two are
 * independent statements and this component derives neither from the other.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code update_order} is the one key an orchestrator reads rather than this component.</b>
 * {@code start-first} overlaps the successor with the predecessor, which is what makes a rollback
 * lossless; {@code stop-first} is the opt-out for an application that cannot be two processes at
 * once — one binder per published host port, one writer per store, one holder of a config volume.
 * It reaches the orchestrator as {@code --update-order}. A repository that says nothing gets
 * {@code start-first}, so an application that must not overlap has to say so.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code health_cmd} and {@code health_path} are alternatives, and setting both is an
 * error.</b> They are not two settings on one gate: the path names a URL a {@code curl} inside the
 * container fetches, and the command replaces that whole mechanism. A deployable image with no
 * HTTP surface — postgres, the first of them — can pass no path-shaped gate, having neither curl
 * nor anything on 8080, so it says how it is ready in its own words instead.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code resources} is a flat comma-separated list, and it will never be anything else.</b>
 * The grammar is {@code postgresql:<name>[:<database>]} because this file has no YAML sequences and
 * no nesting to give it — the same reason {@code deploy_branches} is comma-separated. What a
 * repository names there is a database of its own on the platform's shared postgres, so the two
 * names are allowlisted (see {@link PdIdentifiers#requireResourceName} and {@link
 * PdIdentifiers#requireDatabaseName}), and the {@code qits_} prefix is what keeps the namespace it
 * can reach disjoint from the instance's own.
 *
 * <p><b>Once this key ships it can never become unknown again</b>, and that is worth writing down
 * in the commit that adds it rather than learning later. A spec is fetched at the BUILT sha, so a
 * rollback pin or a redeploy of an older commit presents whatever file that commit carried, and an
 * unknown key fails a deployment. {@code deploy_branches} below is the same lesson, learned the
 * expensive way; this is it applied in advance. Retiring the key later means keeping the tolerance
 * forever, exactly as that one did.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code deploy_branches} is RETIRED: accepted, validated, and acted on by nobody.</b> Where
 * a build deploys was always decided by the environment rows — a green build deploys wherever an
 * environment listens to its branch — so this component never read the key back. Its one reader was
 * qits-workspaces' release flow, which promoted a release onto every branch the list named; that is
 * a fan-out rather than a ladder, and with three tiers it would have shipped a release into all
 * three at once. A release now lands on one entry branch, from that component's own configuration,
 * and no repository states it.
 *
 * <p>It stays accepted for the same reason {@code singleton} does, and the reason is sharper here.
 * <b>A spec is fetched at the BUILT sha</b>, so a rollback pin, a redeploy of an older commit or a
 * repository nobody has edited yet still presents a file carrying the key — and this parser fails a
 * deployment on an unknown one. Making it unknown would turn every such deployment red. Do not
 * write it into a new file, and do not remove the tolerance.
 *
 * <p><b>Strict on purpose.</b> A typo in this file decides where a container runs and what can
 * reach it, and a lenient parser answers a typo with a default — silently deploying the wrong
 * topology and leaving nothing to read. So an unknown key, a repeated key, a value outside the enum
 * and a line that is not {@code key: value} are all errors, and the deployment fails on them. The
 * one thing that is <em>not</em> an error is the file's absence: no file means every default, which
 * is what every repository already behaves like.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code platform} is the canonical target and {@code singleton} is an accepted alias.</b>
 * Both parse to {@link PdDeploymentTarget#PLATFORM} and nothing downstream can tell them apart. The
 * alias exists because the repositories that carry the word were written against the retired
 * vocabulary and must keep deploying across the cutover without a commit each; documentation,
 * error messages and every new file say {@code platform}. It is a tolerance, not a second spelling
 * to maintain — and a value outside both still names only the canonical pair, so a typo is pointed
 * at the word to use.
