/**
 * One attempt to put one commit of one application live. Created {@code QUEUED} by the
 * build-succeeded intake, driven to a terminal state by the deploy worker; the previously {@code
 * ACTIVE} deployment of the same application becomes {@code DECOMMISSIONED} the moment its
 * replacement passes the health gate — never before.
 *
 * <p><b>It names its application and its tier by string, with no FK</b>, even though the topology
 * lives two tables away in the same database. Deployment history outlives the rows that described
 * it: a service removed from the catalogue, or a tier torn down, must not take its history with it,
 * and the rollback pins read off these rows must keep answering whatever the topology says today.
 *
 * <p><b>A {@link CausedRow}, and the one this component exists to trace.</b> A deployment happens
 * <em>because</em> a build went green, so {@link #causationId} names the {@code BuildSuccessful}
 * that caused it and a reader can walk from a container back into the event chain that started it.
 *
 * <p><b>The value is set EXPLICITLY, never left to the stamp</b>, and that is not a preference. The
 * intake hands the whole event to {@code pd-deploy-worker} and returns; an executor hop is exactly
 * where an ambient {@code CausationScope} dies, so the {@code CausationStamp} listener would read
 * null on every row this component writes. The cause therefore crosses the seam as data — a plain
 * {@code UUID} on {@code BuildAnnouncements.announce} — the same way {@link #runId} has always
 * crossed it. The listener stays attached because a value the author set is what it yields to, and
 * because a future writer standing in a scope should be stamped rather than silently rootless.
 *
 * <p>{@link #runId} stays what it is: the pointer into qits-ci's history, resolved against nothing.
 * The two answer different questions — "which pipeline produced the image" and "which event on the
 * bus caused this attempt" — and a manual replay through the HTTP intake can carry either without
 * the other.
