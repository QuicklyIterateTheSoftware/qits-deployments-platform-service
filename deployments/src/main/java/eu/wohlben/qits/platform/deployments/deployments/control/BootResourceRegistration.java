/**
 * Writes this component's own {@code pd_resource} rows from the credentials it was handed to boot.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it exists at all.</b> This component is adopter #1 of its own {@code resources:}
 * contract, and it is the one adopter whose databases cannot have been provisioned by it: the
 * bootstrap creates the roles and the databases over plain JDBC before this process exists, and
 * hands them over as {@code QITS_RESOURCE_<NAME>_URL} / {@code _USERNAME} / {@code _PASSWORD}. The
 * registry would therefore have no row for them, and the first self-deploy would read the empty
 * registry, take the <b>reconcile</b> arm of the idempotency matrix, and {@code ALTER ROLE} its own
 * passwords to fresh ones — while the running instance still holds pools of connections opened with
 * the old ones. Recording what it was given makes that first self-deploy hit the <b>no-op</b> arm
 * instead.
 *
 * <p><b>Two resources, because the spec declares two.</b> {@code db} is this component's own
 * registry; {@code eventstream} is the bus client's claim ledger and outbox, which arrives with the
 * qits-eventstream jar and is a store of its own with its own Flyway lineage. Both are handed over
 * by the bootstrap and both would be rotated by the first self-deploy, so both are recorded. A
 * third entry in {@code .config/qits/deployments.yml} adds a third line to {@link #RESOURCES}, and
 * that is the whole of the change.
 *
 * <p><b>And it survives everything.</b> The row is rewritten on every boot from the environment the
 * container was started with, so it is correct after all containers die, after the registry
 * database is restored, and after an operator rotates the password in deployment config. The environment is
 * the truth here; the row is a copy this component keeps so it can reason about itself the way it
 * reasons about every other application.
 *
 * <p><b>An absent {@code QITS_ENVIRONMENT} is resolved, not read as a plane.</b> It used to mean
 * "the platform plane", because the swarm driver wrote that variable for environment applications
 * only and this component is a platform service — so the rows were recorded under a null tier, and
 * {@link ResourceProvisioning} looked them up by that null. A platform service is deployed INTO the
 * designated platform environment now and is started with the variable like everything else, so the
 * absence means only one thing: <b>this container was started by the old code</b>, in the window
 * between the deploy that ships this file and the one after it. The tier is then resolved from the
 * database — {@code pd_environment.platform}, the same designation the deploying instance used to
 * choose where to put this container — and the row is written under that name, which is the key the
 * next self-deploy will look it up by. Recording null there instead would send that deploy down the
 * reconcile arm and rotate the passwords this process's pools are holding open.
 *
 * <p>Null survives as the last resort and says so in a WARN: an install with no designated tier has
 * nothing to key a row by, and it also has nothing that could deploy this component, so the row is
 * written where the old code wrote it and the operator is told.
 *
 * <p><b>Warn-only, and skipped under TEST</b> — the {@code DeployService.onStart} shape. A
 * component that cannot record its own resource must still start: it is the thing that redeploys
 * the platform, and refusing to boot over a bookkeeping row would be the worst possible trade. A
 * resource without its full triple is not an error either: that is a developer running the jar, and
 * there is nothing to record.
