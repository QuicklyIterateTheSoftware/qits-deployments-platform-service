/**
 * One released version this component has <b>taken responsibility for</b> and has not finished with
 * yet — the acceptance ledger's row.
 *
 * <p><b>It is not a request and must not become one.</b> {@link PdDeploymentRequest} says "this
 * version was asked for HERE, and the gate said yes"; it is written per place, on the worker, after
 * the spec read has decided which places exist. This row is written <em>before</em> any of that, by
 * the door, and says only "an event arrived and nobody has discharged it yet". The gap between the
 * two is precisely where a cutover used to lose releases: the bus's own claim ledger commits when
 * the handler returns, and the handler returns as soon as the release is on an in-memory worker
 * queue that {@code @PreDestroy} then throws away. See {@code V10__owed_release.sql} for the
 * measurement.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link #settledAt} null is the whole of "still owed"</b>, exactly as {@code
 * CiReleaseAnnouncement#announcedAt} is in qits-ci. The row stays afterwards as the account of what
 * was accepted and what became of it, which is the only place a reader can see that a release was
 * superseded rather than merely never deployed.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link #acceptedBy} is the re-drive predicate and nothing else.</b> A row this process
 * holds is in its worker queue and must not be touched however long it sits there; a row held by a
 * process id that is not this one is orphaned by definition, because the queue that held it died
 * with its JVM. Null is "held by nobody" — the state the worker leaves a row it could not discharge
 * in, so this process's own sweep retries it without waiting for a restart.
 *
 * <p><b>Every foreign identity here is a plain string with no FK</b>, this schema's rule since V1:
 * the obligation outlives the catalogue row, the tier and the repository it names.
 *
 * <p><b>A {@link CausedRow} whose cause is set EXPLICITLY</b>, for {@link PdDeploymentRequest}'s
 * reason inverted: this row is written on the <em>door's</em> thread, where {@code CausationScope}
 * does hold the frame's id — but it is also written by the sweep, on a plain daemon thread hours
 * later, where nothing holds anything. One row cannot have its cause from an ambient scope half the
 * time, so the cause travels as data on both paths and {@link CausationStamp} finds it already set.
