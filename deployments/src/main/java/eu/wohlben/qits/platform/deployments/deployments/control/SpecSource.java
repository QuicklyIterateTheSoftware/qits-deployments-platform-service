/**
 * The seam that fetches a repository's deployment spec at a commit — the {@link DeploymentDriver}
 * arrangement again: this module owns the port and the state machine that calls it, {@code service}
 * owns the one implementation that speaks HTTP, and the suites install a scripted fake so a clone's
 * {@code mvn verify} reaches no network.
 *
 * <p>The seam exists because this is the component's <b>one outbound HTTP call</b>. Keeping the
 * client out of a domain module is the same rule that keeps docker out of one: the orchestration
 * must be testable without either. The merge removed the second such client — the topology used to
 * be another service and is now a repository query — so this is the only one left.

  /**
   * What a repository declares about how it is deployed. Every key optional, and the shape a
   * repository with no file at all gets is {@link #DEFAULTS}.
   *
   * <p>{@code healthPath} is the exception rather than the rule: a service that says nothing gets
   * the convention path derived from its name, and only a service whose path does not follow the
   * convention (the gateway owns the root path space) has to name one.
   *
   * <p>{@code healthCmd} <b>replaces</b> that HTTP probe rather than adjusting it: a plain image
   * with no HTTP surface — postgres is the first — declares the command that says it is ready, and
   * the parser refuses a file that sets both. Null means the HTTP probe, which is every service
   * this platform had before deployable images existed.
   *
   * <p>{@code resources} is what the repository asks to have provisioned before its container
   * starts — a database of its own, whose credential arrives as {@code QITS_RESOURCE_<NAME>_*}. An
   * empty list is every application that stores nothing, which is most of them.
   *
   * <p>{@code updateOrder} is how a replacement may overlap what it replaces — {@code start-first}
   * unless the repository says otherwise. It is a repository's answer rather than a platform-wide
   * one because only the repository knows whether two of its processes may run at once: a public
   * host port, a single-writer store or a held config volume each make the overlap impossible. See
   * {@link DeploymentDriver.UpdateOrder}.
   *
   * <p>{@code publishMode} is where a published host port is held — {@code host} unless the
   * repository says {@code ingress}. Only the repository knows, for the same reason: a front door
   * that must survive its own replacement wants the routing mesh holding its port, and everything
   * else keeps the per-node bind it has today. See {@link DeploymentDriver.PublishMode}.
   *
   * <p>{@code host} is the DNS label this application is also served at, and null means "derive
   * it": the parser does not know the application's name, exactly as it does not for a resource's
   * database. {@code browserHostDeclared} is the question that decides whether there is anything to
   * derive — a file that named {@code host} or {@code navigation-entries} asks for a host of its
   * own, and a file carrying only the retired {@code navigation} key asks for none.
   *
   * <p>{@code navigationEntries} is where the application asks to appear. Application-level and a
   * LIST, because one application sits under several headings; empty is an application that creates
   * no navigation option, which is most of them.
   *
   * <p>{@code apiDocs} is where the application's browsable API document lives, under one of its
   * published routes ({@code /ci/q/swagger-ui}). Null is a real answer — a service that documents
   * no HTTP surface — and the parser has already refused a path that sits under no route.
   *
   * <p><b>{@code deployBranches} is read and not used here</b>, and that is deliberate — see {@link
   * #deployBranches()}.
