/**
 * Panache DAO for {@link PdOwedRelease}, the acceptance ledger.
 *
 * <p>Two questions and no more: "is this event already accepted" (the upsert key, so accepting is
 * idempotent across restarts) and "what is owed by somebody who is not here any more" (the sweep).
 * Both are index-backed by V10 — the unique {@code event_id} and the partial index over the unsettled
 * rows.
 *
 * <p><b>And one statement, which is not a third question.</b> {@link #renameRepository} corrects the
 * ADDRESS these rows record when qits-projects renames the repository underneath them; it reads
 * nothing and decides nothing, and its whole argument lives one layer up in {@code
 * ReleaseAcceptance}, which owns the transaction it must run in.

   * serialized platform-wide — and a row carrying anybody else's belonged to a queue that did not
   * survive its JVM. A null {@code accepted_by} is the worker's own hand-back and is included, which

   *
   * <p>{@code seq desc} is what every other listing here orders by; this one is the exception and
   * ascends, because owed work is re-driven in the order it arrived — so two releases of one
   * application replay in their real order and the monotonic collapse sees the newer one last.
