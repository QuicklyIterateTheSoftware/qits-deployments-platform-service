/**
 * A deployment's lifecycle. {@code QUEUED} and {@code STARTING} are the only non-terminal states,
 * and neither survives a restart (the worker queue is in-memory; the startup sweep settles them).
 *
 * <p><b>{@code FAILED} used to be five different outcomes.</b> A row that said it could mean the
 * apply was refused, the successor never converged and the orchestrator put the predecessor back, a
 * restart interrupted the row and a newer deployment took its place, or a container that had been
 * serving for hours was found gone — four questions with four different answers ("is anything
 * serving?", "does somebody have to act?") flattened into one word. So three of them are their own
 * words now: {@link #ROLLED_BACK}, {@link #SUPERSEDED} and {@link #GONE}. Nothing was removed and no
 * row was relabelled — the column is a varchar with no check constraint precisely so a vocabulary
 * can grow, and every historical {@code FAILED} still says what it said. {@code FAILED} keeps the
 * remainder, narrowed to its honest meaning: the attempt ended and nothing is known to serve.
 *
 * <p><b>The terminal states are terminal but not final.</b> {@code ACTIVE}, {@code FAILED} and
 * {@code GONE} are the ones a container's own state can contradict, so the periodic observation
 * ({@code DeploymentObserver}) settles the disagreement on the LATEST row of each (application,
 * tier): a {@code FAILED} or {@code GONE} row whose own container is running and healthy becomes
 * {@code ACTIVE}, and an {@code ACTIVE} row whose container is absent or terminally exited on two
 * consecutive passes becomes {@code GONE}. The rest are nobody's to observe — {@code QUEUED} and
 * {@code STARTING} belong to the worker's state machine, {@code IMAGE_MISSING} is a statement about
 * a registry rather than a container, {@code SUPERSEDED} is a statement about a row a later
 * deployment overtook, and {@code DECOMMISSIONED} is a decision another deployment made. A row that
 * is not the latest for its place is history and is never revisited.
