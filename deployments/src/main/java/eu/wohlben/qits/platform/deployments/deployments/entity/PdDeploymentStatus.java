/**
 * A deployment's lifecycle. {@code QUEUED} and {@code STARTING} are the only non-terminal states,
 * and neither survives a restart (the worker queue is in-memory; the startup sweep settles them).
 *
 * <p><b>{@code FAILED} used to be five different outcomes.</b> A row that said it could mean the
 * apply was refused, the successor never converged and the orchestrator put the predecessor back, a
 * restart interrupted the row and a newer deployment took its place, or a container that had been
 * serving for hours was found gone — four questions with four different answers ("is anything
 * serving?", "does somebody have to act?") flattened into one word. So three of them are their own
 * words now: {@link #ROLLED_BACK}, {@link #SUPERSEDED} and {@link #GONE}. Nothing was removed and no
 * row was relabelled — the column is a varchar with no check constraint precisely so a vocabulary
 * can grow, and every historical {@code FAILED} still says what it said. {@code FAILED} keeps the
 * remainder, narrowed to its honest meaning: the attempt ended and nothing is known to serve.
 *
 * <p><b>The terminal states are terminal but not final.</b> {@code ACTIVE}, {@code FAILED} and
 * {@code GONE} are the ones a container's own state can contradict, so the periodic observation
 * ({@code DeploymentObserver}) settles the disagreement on the LATEST row of each (application,
 * tier): a {@code FAILED} or {@code GONE} row whose own container is running and healthy becomes
 * {@code ACTIVE}, and an {@code ACTIVE} row whose container is absent or terminally exited on two
 * consecutive passes becomes {@code GONE}. The rest are nobody's to observe — {@code QUEUED} and
 * {@code STARTING} belong to the worker's state machine, {@code IMAGE_MISSING} is a statement about
 * a registry rather than a container, {@code SPEC_UNREADABLE} is a statement about the git host,
 * {@code SUPERSEDED} is a statement about a row a later deployment overtook, and {@code
 * DECOMMISSIONED} is a decision another deployment made. A row that is not the latest for its place
 * is history and is never revisited.
 *
 * <p><b>One of them is settled by a retry rather than by an observation</b>: {@link
 * #SPEC_UNREADABLE} is re-attempted by {@code DeployService} on the same cadence, because what has
 * to be re-asked there is the file rather than a container.

   * The repository's {@code .config/qits/deployments.yml} could not be READ at the released tag,

   * at all. <b>Nothing about the repository is being claimed</b>: the file was never seen, so this
   * indicts the hop rather than the commit.
   *
   * <p><b>It is the one terminal-looking word that is not terminal</b>, and that is the whole
   * reason it exists. Every spec failure used to be {@code FAILED} — a row nothing revisits — so a
   * release whose single deploy attempt met an intermittent 403 from qits-githost stranded until
   * somebody replayed it by hand; three did, for 13 to 17 minutes each, on 2026-09-04. A row that
   * says this is re-read on the deployment observation's own cadence ({@code
   * qits.platform.deployments.observe-interval-seconds}) until the file answers — at which point
   * the release deploys for real and this row becomes history — or until a newer version of the
   * same application supersedes it, which is the ordinary exit.
   *
   * <p><b>A spec problem that is the repository's own is NOT this.</b> A file that does not parse,
   * or a key the schema refuses, stays {@code FAILED}: it was read, and reading it again answers
   * the same thing. A repository carrying no file at all is neither — it gets every default and
   * deploys, exactly as it did before the file existed.
   *
   * <p>Nothing observes it: it names no container, so {@code DeploymentObserver} skips it like every
   * other row that never reached a {@code docker run}. The retry is {@code DeployService}'s, on the
   * deploy worker, beside the observation pass rather than inside it.
