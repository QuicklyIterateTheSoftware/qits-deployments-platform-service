/**
 * <b>Re-drives what an earlier process accepted and never deployed.</b> The other half of {@link
 * ReleaseAcceptance}, and the thing that turns "the event was claimed" into "the release was
 * deployed" across a cutover.
 *
 * <p>The claim ledger in qits-eventstream settles a {@code SoftwareRelease} the moment this
 * component's handler returns, and the handler returns as soon as the release is on the in-memory
 * {@code pd-deploy-worker} queue that {@code @PreDestroy} then throws away. Everything still on that
 * queue at a cutover was, before this class existed, lost silently and forever — the successor's
 * catch-up sweep found the claim and skipped the event. This is what reads those obligations back.
 *
 * <h2>What it re-drives, and what it refuses to</h2>
 *
 * <p>Only obligations {@link ReleaseAcceptance#orphaned() nobody is holding} — a row stamped with
 * this process's own instance id is on its worker queue and is left alone however long it sits
 * there. Each one is then put through the SAME three questions the live door answers, in the same
 * order, so a re-drive is an ordinary announcement and never a bypass:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Has this exact version already been requested?</b> Then the obligation was met by the
 *       process that died holding it — the request row was written, the container may even be live —
 *       and re-driving would mint a duplicate. Settled {@code ALREADY_REQUESTED}.
 *   <li><b>Is it still the tip?</b> {@link ReleaseTips} answers, exactly as it does on the live
 *       path, against a floor read from the request rows because a freshly booted process remembers
 *       nothing. A release that a newer one has overtaken is settled {@code SUPERSEDED} rather than
 *       deployed: replaying it would be a rollback nobody asked for, which is the one thing a
 *       re-drive must never be able to cause.
 *   <li><b>Anything else</b> goes through {@link ReleaseAnnouncements#announceDurably}, which is the
 *       identical call the bus door makes — the identifier validation, the spec read at the released
 *       tag, derived registration, the request row, the queue, the health-gated cutover. Nothing
 *       here shortcuts any of it, so a release whose spec cannot be read is refused on the re-drive
 *       exactly as it was refused live.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The two answers above are settled by <em>this</em> class rather than by the worker, because
 * they are decisions not to deploy: nothing would run, so nothing would discharge the row.
 *
 * <h2>When it runs</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Once at startup, which is the cutover case exactly</b>, and then on a tick. The startup pass
 * is what recovers the previous container's queue; the tick is the belt for the two things the
 * startup pass cannot cover — a boot that ran while this component's own postgres was still coming
 * up, and an obligation this process took up and handed back after failing to discharge it.
 *
 * <p>It is a plain daemon thread rather than {@code quarkus-scheduler}, following {@link
 * DeployService}'s observation ticker: this component's whole ordering story is "one worker, in
 * queue order", and a scheduler extension would add a second thread pool and a second concurrency
 * model to it. Nothing is done ON this thread but the reading and the guards — every announcement
 * lands on the deploy worker, behind whatever is already queued.

   * synchronously — it reads every {@code QUEUED}/{@code STARTING} row and settles each one as

   * first, this sweep could put a fresh {@code QUEUED} row in front of that read and have the
