/**
 * Environment lifecycle <b>with its docker side</b>: the operational door onto {@link
 * EnvironmentService}, which owns the rows and touches nothing else.
 *
 * <p>The split is the module partition made concrete. Creating a tier is a row; making its network
 * is a container-runtime act. Deleting a tier is a row; reaping its containers and removing its
 * networks is not. Everything in the second half needs the docker seam, and the docker seam belongs
 * to the execution domain — so this class is where the two halves are composed, and it is the only
 * place that knows the order they go in.
 *
 * <p>Reads pass straight through. They are here so a caller has one door rather than two, not
 * because there is anything to add to them.

  /**
   * Tear the environment down: the recorded deployments, then the containers and the networks, then

   *
   * <p><b>Docker first, the rows last</b>, and the order is the contract. The teardown is
   * label-driven — it reaps by {@code qits.platform.deployments.environment} and removes the
   * networks carrying that id — so it needs nothing from the topology, but deleting the tier first
   * would leave a failed teardown with no row to retry it from. Deleting last means a half-finished
   * teardown is still addressable.
   *
   * <p>The runtime half is best-effort otherwise: a teardown must succeed even when the daemon
   * already lost the services.
   *
   * <p>The order between the container reap and the network removal is load-bearing too. Platform
   * services live on this environment's networks without being this environment's,
   * so they survive the reap and would then hold every network open — docker refuses
   * to remove a network with an endpoint on it. The plane is detached first ({@link
   * DeploymentDriver#detachPlatformPlane}, which is nothing at all under swarm, where a service's
   * networks are declared rather than joined), and only the networks THIS environment owns (its bundle plus
   * everything labelled with its id) are removed, so a platform service keeps every other
   * environment it serves.
   *
   * <p><b>The legacy network is never one of them.</b> An environment may have been created with
   * {@code qits.platform.deployments.legacy-network} as its bundle — the dev tier IS that case, its
   * bundle is {@code qits-net} — and it is not that environment's to take away: it is the
   * transition membership of every container on the host, platform services included. Disconnecting
   * them from it would cut qits-idp off from the platform, and this component would be doing it to
   * itself mid-request. So it is skipped for both steps, and the environment's derived
   * per-application networks still go.
   *
   * <p><b>The platform environment is refused.</b> It is the tier a release enters at and the tier
   * the platform plane is deployed into, so tearing it down would leave qits-platform-idp and the
   * rest with nowhere to deploy — running, unreachable by any future release, and with nothing in
   * the model to say why. Designate another environment first; that is a move, and it leaves the
   * plane with a tier throughout.
   *
   * <p><b>And the reap does not take the plane with it</b>, which the label alone no longer
   * guarantees: a platform service carries this tier's environment label now, so {@link
   * DeploymentDriver#removeEnvironmentContainers} demands the {@code target=environment} label
   * beside it. That refusal above means the designated tier is never the one being torn down, but
   * the two guards are independent on purpose — a designation moved a minute earlier would
   * otherwise make a teardown reap the plane.
