/**
 * The deployment succeeded: this container passed the health gate, the cutover was recorded, and
 * this commit of this application is what serves now. <b>The one event on this bus that says a
 * change is live.</b>
 *
 * <p>Its common fields are {@link DeploymentQueued}'s, argued there.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code containerName} is the fact a consumer cannot derive.</b> The name is built from the
 * deployment id rather than the sha — re-deploying one commit must never collide with the container
 * it replaces — so it is knowable only from here. It is what a person greps the host for.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code endpoints} is the complete, immutable routing snapshot.</b> It includes the resolved
 * wire alias rather than asking consumers to reimplement a deployer convention. An empty list is a
 * service that declares no public routes; consumers replace, never merge, the prior snapshot.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code browserHost} is the one DNS label this application is served at</b> — {@code ci} in
 * {@code ci.dev.wohlben.eu} — and null is a real answer: an application that asks for no host of
 * its own is reached under its path prefix, as every application was. The edge builds the authority
 * around the label; the label alone is what travels, so one deployment describes itself on every
 * environment and domain the platform has.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code navigation} is application-level and replaces the label an endpoint used to carry.</b>
 * One application can sit under several headings — a repository's Docs, CI and Workspaces are the
 * same three entries under six categories — and a per-route label could say none of that. Empty is
 * an application that creates no navigation option at all, which is most of them.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code apiDocsPath} is where this application's browsable API document lives</b>, under one
 * of its published routes ({@code /ci/q/swagger-ui}), and null is a real answer: a service that
 * documents no HTTP surface. Like the routes it is a path and never an origin — the edge composes
 * the authority around it.
 *
 * <p>{@code occurredAt} is {@code finishedAt}, the value the cutover bookkeeping wrote on the row.
 * The predecessor it decommissioned announces nothing: a deployment being replaced is this event
 * seen from the other side, and a consumer that wants "what is live" reads the newest event per
 * (application, tier).
