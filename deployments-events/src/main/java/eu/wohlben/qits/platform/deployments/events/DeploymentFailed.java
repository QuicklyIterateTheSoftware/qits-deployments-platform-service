/**
 * The deployment ended badly: nothing was cut over, and whatever was serving before still is. Every
 * terminal outcome that is not {@link DeploymentActive} arrives as this event.
 *
 * <p>Its common fields are {@link DeploymentQueued}'s, argued there.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code status} is a string carrying the deployer's own terminal state</b> — {@code FAILED},
 * {@code IMAGE_MISSING} or {@code ROLLED_BACK} — rather than one event type per outcome or a
 * boolean. They are one thing to a consumer ("this did not go live") and different things to a
 * person: an image the registry does not have yet is the expected outcome for an application
 * nothing publishes, and a rollback means the predecessor is still serving. Folding either into
 * {@code FAILED} would page somebody for it.
 *
 * <p><b>That the field is a string is what let the vocabulary grow without a fifth event.</b> A
 * word added here reaches every consumer as data; one that switches on the value learns a new one
 * and one that only cares "not live" is untouched. An enum on the wire would have been a shared
 * type, and cross-context references here are plain values.
 *
 * <p>Two of the deployer's words never arrive on this event, deliberately: {@code SUPERSEDED} is
 * written by the startup sweep and {@code GONE} by the periodic observation, and neither announces
 * anything — both restate an outcome minutes or hours after the fact, which a consumer would first
 * have to know supersedes the earlier statement.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code detail} is docker's own output or this component's own sentence, and it is
 * nullable.</b> It is a diagnosis for a person, never something to parse — the wording is whatever
 * the failing tool said and is not a contract. A null field is omitted from the canonical payload
 * rather than written as an explicit null.
 *
 * <p>{@code containerName} is absent, unlike on {@link DeploymentActive}: most failures happen
 * before a container exists, and the ones that do not have already removed it by the time this is
 * published. A name that resolves to nothing is worse than no name.
 *
 * <p>{@code occurredAt} is {@code finishedAt}, the value the outcome bookkeeping wrote on the row.
