/**
 * Execution began: the deploy worker took this queued deployment and moved it to {@code STARTING}.
 * Everything slow — the pull, the cutover, the health gate — happens after this and before the
 * terminal event.
 *
 * <p>Its fields are {@link DeploymentQueued}'s, argued there. What it adds is a second point in
 * time, which is what makes the queue wait measurable: deployments are serialized on one worker, so
 * the gap between a queue event and its start event is how long this one waited behind the others.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code startedAt} is read off a clock rather than off the row, and it is the one timestamp
 * here that is.</b> The deployment row carries {@code created_at} and {@code finished_at} and no
 * column for the {@code STARTING} transition, so there is nothing to read back. It is taken inside
 * the transaction that writes the transition, so it is still when the thing happened and not when
 * the announcement was made — the property that matters — and a column would only be a second copy
 * of it. If one is ever added, this field reads it and nothing else changes.
 *
 * <p>There is no container name yet: the container is named after the deployment and created some
 * way further on, past the pull. {@link DeploymentActive} is where it appears.
