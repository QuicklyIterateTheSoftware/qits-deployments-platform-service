/**
 * "This service runs in this environment." The whole of the topology is these rows.
 *
 * <p>A link says nothing about how the service runs — that is on {@link PdService}, once, for every
 * environment it is linked into. What a link adds is presence, and only presence: the deploy
 * orchestration asks which services are linked into an environment and reconciles the running
 * containers and networks against the answer.
 *
 * <p><b>No link meant EVERY environment once, and it means none now.</b> That was the platform
 * plane's whole mechanism — "present everywhere" spelled as "linked nowhere in particular", so the
 * link query composed the tier's own services with every service carrying none — and an upsert that
 * gave such a service links was refused rather than stored. The plane is deleted: a service is
 * present exactly where it is linked, so a row with no link runs nowhere and there is nothing left to
 * refuse.
 *
 * <p>The link set of a service is <b>replaced</b> on every upsert, never merged. The
 * writer knows the whole set (it read the repository's own spec); a merge would keep a link to an
 * environment the repository has stopped naming, and nothing would ever remove it.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code @Uncaused} by decision, and the replace-never-merge rule above is the reason.</b>
 * Every upsert deletes this row and inserts it again, so a causation column here would not record
 * what caused the link to exist — it would record the most recent build that restated it, an
 * update timestamp wearing a trace column's name. The two questions worth asking are answered next
 * door: {@link PdService} carries the event that put the service in the catalogue, and each {@code
 * PdDeployment} carries the event that rolled it out.
