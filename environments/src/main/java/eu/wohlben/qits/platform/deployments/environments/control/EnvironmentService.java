/**
 * Environment lifecycle, <b>rows only</b>: creation with the bundle network's convention filled in
 * ({@code qits-env-<name>}), rename, designation, and removal.
 *
 * <p>An environment is a <b>tier</b> and is created deliberately — nothing derives one. What is
 * derived is everything inside it: a release registers the repository's service and links it into
 * the entry tier, so this call creates the tier and the releases fill it.
 *
 * <p><b>There is no branch here any more.</b> A tier listened to {@code environment/<name>} while a
 * green build was the trigger; a release names a tag, so where a version lands is the {@code
 * platform} designation and nothing else. V8 dropped the column.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here touches docker</b>, and that is the module boundary rather than a phase.
 * Creating an environment writes a row and names a network; making that network, reaping the tier's
 * containers and removing its networks belong to the execution domain, which composes this service
 * with the driver in {@code EnvironmentOperations}. Keeping the two apart is what lets the topology
 * be reasoned about — and tested — without a docker seam in front of it, and it is why the
 * dependency runs one way.
 *
 * <p>Transactions are programmatic (the platform's stance) rather than {@code @Transactional},
 * because the bracket then cannot be lost to a self-invocation that never crosses the interceptor.
 * The reads take {@link QuarkusTransaction#joiningExisting()}; <b>the three writes take {@link
 * DbRetry#inNewTx}, which IS their {@code requiringNew}</b> — see {@link #writeDeadline}.

   * Make this the platform environment, by <b>moving</b> the designation rather than setting it:

   * H2 has none (V2's comment, and V1 reached the same answer about null rows), so there is no
   * second enforcement to fall back on and this must stay the only way the flag goes true.

   * would register nothing and quietly deploy nowhere.
