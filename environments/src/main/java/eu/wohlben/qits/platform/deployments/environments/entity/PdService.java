/**
 * One deployable service of the platform, named once for the whole platform rather than once per
 * tier. The name is load-bearing three times over: it is the image path in the OCI registry ({@code
 * <repository>/<name>:<sha>}), the network alias peers resolve, and part of every container name
 * the deploy orchestration derives from it.
 *
 * <p><b>There is one row per service, not one per (service, environment).</b> Which tiers a service
 * runs in is said by its {@link PdServiceLink}s, and that is what lets a reader ask both questions
 * — "what is this service" and "where does it run" — without joining a name to itself across
 * environments.
 *
 * <p><b>A service is defined by its links and by nothing else.</b> {@code deployment_target} used to
 * sit here and say which PLANE a service was on; the plane is deleted, so a service with no link
 * runs nowhere rather than everywhere, and the registration that writes this row always states the
 * tier it registered into.
 *
 * <p>Rows here are <b>derived</b>: a green build carries the deploy orchestration to the
 * repository's {@code .config/qits/deployments.yml} at that sha, and the row is created or brought
 * up to date from what it found. Nothing registers a service by hand, and nothing needs to — a
 * repository that has never been built simply has no row.
 *
 * <p>{@link #branch} is <b>vestigial</b>: nothing decides a deployment on it any more. See the
 * field.
 *
 * <p><b>A {@link CausedRow}, and the insert-only stamp is exactly right for it.</b> The row is
 * created once, by the green build that first registered the repository, and every later upsert
 * updates it in place — so "which event caused this service to enter the catalogue" is one lasting
 * fact rather than a value that churns. It is filled two ways, because the two writers stand on
 * different threads: derived registration runs on {@code pd-deploy-worker} behind the intake's
 * queue hop, where no ambient scope survives, so {@code ServiceCatalog.upsert} takes the cause as
 * an argument and sets it; an operator's {@code PUT} on the service API reaches the same insert on
 * the request thread, where {@link CausationStamp} fills it from the filter's restored scope.
