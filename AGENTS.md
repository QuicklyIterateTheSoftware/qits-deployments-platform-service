# qits-deployments — working notes

Read `README.md` first: it defines the model (tiers, two planes, derived rows) and the flow (green
build → registration → health-gated cutover). This file is the working conventions on top of it.

## The two rules that shape everything

**A clone of this repo alone builds and tests green** — no monorepo, no docker, no prior
`mvn install` elsewhere, no credentials, **no network**. That is why the poms duplicate versions
instead of inheriting them, and why every seam that reaches outside the process is faked rather than
skipped: `FakeDeploymentDriver` behind `DeploymentDriver` (the orchestrator), `FakeSpecSource` behind
`SpecSource` (the git host) and `FakeResourceProvisioner` behind `ResourceProvisioner` (the
platform's postgres). **Three fakes** — the ancestor's fourth, a stub HTTP server for the topology,
dissolved when the topology became a repository query.

**The fourth seam, `DeploymentExtrasSource`, has no `@Mock` fake and that is deliberate** — it
returns a `Config` rather than holding a conversation, so a test states one in a lambda. Nothing
about it reaches the network in the shipped state either: `qits.platform.deployments.extras-url` is
unset, so the suite reads the same config it always read. See the extras section below.

The one thing the suite does start is a **postgres of its own**: the component's store is one now,
and `testdb/EmbeddedPg` spawns zonky's real binaries as a child process. A maven dependency, not a
container — the rule is no docker, and it still holds.

**Which command is the gate depends on whether you have the client** (`git clone … && git submodule
update --init`):

- `./mvnw test` — needs **neither node nor the webui submodule**. Quinoa is disabled by default in
  test mode, so every `@QuarkusTest` here passes against an empty `webui/` on a machine with no node.
- `./mvnw verify` — runs `package` on its way to failsafe, and `package` is where Quinoa augments. So
  verify needs **both**, and against an uninitialised submodule it fails with
  `No package.json found in Web UI directory: 'src/main/webui'`.

Always `clean verify`, and the suite takes a free port —
`service/src/test/resources/application.properties` sets `quarkus.http.test-port=0`, because on the
deployment host 8081 is the platform's own npm registry and `@QuarkusTest` restarts race for it
anywhere. Failsafe passes the same 0 to the packaged artifact.

**`service/` compiles to a GraalVM native image.** `.sdkmanrc` names `25.0.2-graalce`, so `sdk env`
gives you a `native-image` and `./mvnw verify -Dnative` produces
`service/target/qits-platform-deployments` and runs `PdPackagedSurfaceIT` against it. Consequences to
keep in your head: a missing GraalVM does not fail the build (Quarkus falls back to a container build
— grep the log for `Cannot find the native-image`); prefer what is already in the image
(`ProcessBuilder` over a docker client library — the reason `PdProcess` shells out); every config
default the app boots with is part of the native surface (the AUTO_SERVER lesson, which now reads as:
the datasource ships an *expression* over `QITS_RESOURCE_DB_*` and no fallback URL at all, so there
is no default with a feature in it to lose); and anything returned as `Response.entity(...)` is invisible to the build-time
Jackson analysis, which is what `api/ApiWireReflection` exists for. **A new response type joins that
list in the commit that adds it** — the failure is a 500 in the native binary while every JVM test
stays green, and it has been paid for once already.

**There is a second such list now, `bus/EventWireReflection`, and it exists for a different
reason**: `CanonicalJson` builds its own `ObjectMapper` on purpose — the payload string is a
byte-for-byte wire contract and a consuming application's customizers must not reach it — so the
whole graph it binds is invisible to the same analysis. It registers the consuming path
(`EventFrame`, the package-private `EventPage` by string name, and the payload record). Leave
`EventPage` out and the stream works in the binary while **catch-up alone** fails, which is the half
nobody would be watching. **The publishing path joined it when this component got events of its
own**: the four `DeploymentQueued`/`Started`/`Active`/`Failed` records, `EventEnvelope`, and
`CanonicalJson$QitsEventMixin` by string name because it is nested in the library. The mix-in is the
quiet one — it is what keeps `eventId` out of the payload, so its absence is a wire contract that
changed with no crash and no log. **A fifth event joins the list in the commit that adds it.**

## The partition, and the one rule that keeps it

Four maven modules, package root `eu.wohlben.qits.platform.deployments`:

- **`environments/`** (`…environments.*`) — the topology: `entity`, `persistence`, `dto`, `mapper`,
  `control`, `error`. `EnvironmentService` (tier rows), `ServiceCatalog` (services, links and the
  three rules over them), `PdIdentifiers` (what the topology stores), `PdNetworks`,
  `ApplicationKeys`. **It also owns the datasource, the persistence unit and the Flyway lineage** —
  one database, declared once, in the module both others depend on.
- **`deployments/`** (`…deployments.*`) — the execution: `DeployService`, `EnvironmentOperations`,
  `RollbackPins`, `DeploymentSpecParser`, `DeploymentIdentifiers` (what only reaches an argv),
  `ImageRefs`, `ContainerNames`, `PdProcess`, `ResourceProvisioning` and `BootResourceRegistration`,
  and the four seams `DeploymentDriver` / `SpecSource` / `ResourceProvisioner` /
  `DeploymentExtrasSource` plus the announcement port `ReleaseAnnouncements` and the ordering
  collapse `ReleaseTips` behind it (with `Versions` and `PackageNames`), and the outgoing port
  `DeployAnnouncer`.
- **`deployments-events/`** (`…deployments.events.*`) — the event VOCABULARY: four plain records
  over `qits-eventstream` and nothing else, not even quarkus-arc. It is a module rather than a
  package because a vocabulary is what a *consumer* needs: the day another service listens for
  `DeploymentActive` it takes this jar and gets the record plus the bus and no part of the deployer.
  The ci-events and githost-events shape, which is also why the directory carries the repo's name
  rather than a bare role word.
- **`service/`** (`…api`, `…bus`, `…swarmhost`, `…githost`, `…pghost`, `…confighost`) — the
  adapters. `confighost` is the youngest and is the one that presents a credential: it reads
  qits-configuration's resolved extras and holds the named oidc client that does it. `bus` is the
  event-bus half: the durable `SoftwareRelease` subscriber, the `DeployEventAnnouncer` that
  publishes this component's own four events, and the native-image registration for what the
  library's own `ObjectMapper` binds. Identity is not a package here: the forward-auth pair
  lives in the published `qits-auth-core`.

**`platform` is a namespace qualifier, not half of a word** — hence `…qits.platform.deployments`
rather than `…qits.platformdeployments`. The execution module therefore lands at
`…qits.platform.deployments.deployments`, next to `…qits.platform.deployments.environments`: the
repetition is the price of a qualifier that names the plane, and renaming the module package to
dodge it would cost the pairing with `environments`. The artifactIds (`qits-platform-deployments-*`)
and the REST path (`/platform-deployments/api`) are unaffected and stay as they are.

**`deployments` depends on `environments` and never the reverse.** That is the partition, and it is
the thing to defend. Execution reads and writes the topology; the topology knows nothing about
containers. The concrete consequence is `EnvironmentOperations`: creating a tier is a row
(`environments`) *and* a network (`deployments`), so the composition lives on the execution side and
`EnvironmentService` stays socketless. Do not put a driver call in `environments/`.

**The seam rule is one rule, applied four times.** Everything the domain modules cannot do — shell
out to docker, fetch a file over HTTP, speak DDL to somebody else's server — is an interface there
and an implementation in `service/`, with a scripted double in the suite. `ResourceProvisioner` was
the third; **`DeploymentExtrasSource` is the fourth** and took the shape unchanged. Do not put a
client in a domain module.

**The fourth one's double is a lambda, not a `@Mock` bean, and that is the seam's own shape.**
`DeploymentExtrasSource` is a `@FunctionalInterface` returning a `Config`, so a test that wants the
file behaviour writes `application -> ExtrasSnapshot.over(boot, file)` and a test that wants a
served one writes the map. There is no `FakeDeploymentExtrasSource` to reset, because nothing here
is a conversation to script. What IS scripted is the HTTP — `confighost/ExtrasStub`, the JDK's own
server on a real socket — and only for `ConfigHostExtrasSource`'s own tests, where the request is
what is under test: the url it is built at, the headers it carries and the patience it spends. A
fake at the seam there would assert this suite's model of a client.

## What the merge dissolved (do not bring it back)

The topology was `qits-serviceregistry` for one release, reached over HTTP. All of the following is
**gone on purpose**, and each of them is a thing an agent might reasonably try to re-add:

- **`RegistryClient` and `HttpRegistryClient`.** Registration writes rows in the same transaction;
  resolution is a repository query. `ServiceCatalog` and `EnvironmentService` are called directly.
- **`RegistryBearer`** — the class. **The `quarkus-oidc-client` block came BACK**, and this entry is
  the promise being kept rather than broken: "if this service ever calls a guarded peer again, all
  three arrive in that commit". qits-configuration is that peer, and all three arrived —
  `confighost/IdpExtrasBearer` over a **named** client, the shipped-off switch
  (`quarkus.oidc-client.configuration.client-enabled=false`) and a secret a deployment supplies.
  What stays gone is the topology client it used to serve. **The peer count is one**: a second named
  client is a second peer, and a second peer wants the argument this one made.
- **`StubRegistry`**, the `@WithTestResource(GLOBAL)` server every `@QuarkusTest` carried.
- **The registry-outage posture** — `RegistryException` (502), `lastKnownTargets` (the
  deployment-history fallback), `CdRegistryOutageTest`. There is no outage to have a posture about.
  The **spec read** keeps its posture exactly as it was, because it is still a remote call.
- **`RegistryExport`**, the one-time boot seeding of the registry from local tables, and the frozen
  `cd_environment`/`cd_application` tables it read. Clean start: one V1, no lineage inherited.

What survived from that seam is the *claims*, rewritten against the local domain:
`PdRegistrationTest` holds what a green build writes and reads back; `PdPinApiTest` holds that the
pins read nothing but deployment rows, which was the outage suite's one claim that was never about
the peer.

**The hazard the merge created, and it bit once already.** The topology is now read from the deploy
**worker** — a bare daemon thread with no request context and no transaction — where the ancestor
made an HTTP call that needed neither. Hibernate throws `ContextNotActiveException` there. So every
read on `ServiceCatalog` and `EnvironmentService` brackets itself with
`QuarkusTransaction.joiningExisting()`: joining rather than requiring a new one, so a caller that
already has a transaction keeps its entities managed. **A new read method on either class needs that
bracket**, and a `@QuarkusTest` that only drives the REST surface will not catch its absence — the
request context hides it. `PdDeploymentFlowTest` is what catches it.

## The worker

`DeployService` runs **the whole of a software-release event** on a single-threaded daemon worker
(`pd-deploy-worker`), the `CiRunService` shape: the intake validates and returns, each DB transition
sits in its own `QuarkusTransaction.requiringNew()` bracket, and everything the docker calls need is
copied out of the entities into a plain `Plan` record first.

Serial execution is load-bearing twice over:

- it makes "the previous ACTIVE deployment" an uncontended read during cutover;
- it makes derived registration's read-then-write atomic against every other event. `ServiceCatalog.
  upsert` is `synchronized` as the belt for every other caller, and the unique service name is a
  third — but the worker is what makes the *pair* (read the links, write the union) atomic, and
  neither of the other two covers that. `twoIdenticalEventsArrivingTogetherRegisterOnePlatformService`
  holds it.

The cost is that the spec's HTTP read sits in the queue too;
`qits.platform.deployments.git-host-timeout-seconds` bounds it. `awaitIdle()` is public for the suite, because "nothing was registered" can only be
asserted after the worker has had the event.

Transactions are programmatic everywhere in `control`, never `@Transactional` — partly for the
worker, partly because a `this.`-invocation never crosses the interceptor and a lost bracket fails
quietly.

The startup sweep (`DeployService.onStart`) settles rows left `QUEUED`/`STARTING` by a crash — see
"One orchestrator, one seam" for what settles them — and **deliberately reaps no containers**: a
deployed application outlives its deployer, and whatever was ACTIVE before the restart is still
serving. Do not "complete" the sweep with a reap.

**The worker survives losing its own datasource, in exactly three brackets.** This component deploys
qits-oci-postgresql — the postgres its own registry lives in — so cutting that container over kills
every connection the deployment performing it is holding. It did: eaa34fbc cut over cleanly, went
healthy, and then ended `FAILED: [unexpected: JDBCConnectionException …]` because the post-gate
bookkeeping ran on dead connections, while a second event was dropped the same way in the worker's
own catch. `DbRetry` wraps the catalogue read an event opens with, the cutover bookkeeping and
`finish` — **connection-class failures only** (SQLState `08*`/`57P0x`, the pool's acquisition
timeout, Hibernate's `JDBCConnectionException`), thirty seconds of half-second sleeps, safe because
the worker is single-threaded and those three brackets re-read what they write.

**`DbRetry` is the platform's now** — `eu.wohlben.qits.db.DbRetry` from `qits-db-core`, published by
qits-integrations-quarkus-javalib. It was a private class here first, and the lib's is that class
with the budget moved from a constant to a per-call argument; the thirty seconds are stated at each
call site as `DeployService.CUTOVER_BUDGET` (package-private, because `DeploymentObserver` wraps its
brackets for the same reason and one budget spelled twice would drift). The lib's own suite pins
every failure shape this component ever saw, which is why the local `DbRetryTest` went with the
local class.

**It has two spellings and the choice is not a style one — it is who owns the transaction.**
`DbRetry.call` wraps a block; `DbRetry.inNewTx`/`runInNewTx` **is** the `requiringNew`. Owning the
boundary is what lets the retry tell "the body threw it, so it certainly never committed" from
"the transaction manager reported it", which is the one round trip nothing can place — Narayana
spells a lost commit and a real rollback with the same `RollbackException`, measured. So:

- a **read** bracketed by the callee (`catalog.find`, `environments.onBranch`) keeps `call`;
- a **write** that used to read `DbRetry.call(…, () -> requiringNew().call(…))` is now `inNewTx`
  with the `requiringNew` gone — the worker's cutover bookkeeping and `finish`, and all three of
  `DeploymentObserver`'s brackets;
- and each of those bodies ends with a `flush()`. An ORM flushes at commit by default, which would
  put every statement on the far side of the undecidable round trip; flushed, a lost connection is a
  body failure and is retried. Without the flush the wrap reports rather than helps.

`DbRetry.call` around a write survives in exactly one place, `ServiceCatalog.upsert`, and its
javadoc argues why: the boundary there has to stay inside a `synchronized`, so what makes a second
attempt safe is the write's own converging shape rather than the retry's knowledge.

**It is the second half of a pair, and the first half is the pool.** The datasource carries the
platform's three-line baseline — `jdbc.driver=eu.wohlben.qits.db.PatientPgDriver`,
`validate-on-borrow=true`, `acquisition-timeout=15S` — so a connection request is held while postgres
comes back rather than failing at once. `DatasourceBaselineTest` (qits-arch-rules, beside
`ArchRulesTest` and in `service/` for the same reason) fails the build naming any postgresql
datasource missing a line. That includes the `eventstream` one, which the pinned qits-eventstream
release ships bare: `service/`'s `application.properties` states the three lines for it, and that
block is marked to delete when a release of that jar carries them itself.

**What is deliberately NOT retried, and it is a rule rather than an omission:** `queue`,
`recordRejection`, the `STARTING` transition and the platform conversion. They insert or move rows,
so a commit whose outcome the connection died before reporting would be duplicated by a second
attempt — and all of them run before anything docker-side has happened, so losing one drops the
event with nothing half-done. Retry what comes *after* a container is running, where dropping the
work leaves a live container with no row that admits it. Never a business failure: a 409 retried is
one visible failure turned into a slow one.

**The REST reads are patient too, and the wrap is in the CONTROLLERS.** `PdReadPatience` (in `api`)
spends `qits.platform.deployments.db-retry-deadline` — 15S shipped, not the worker's 30 — on every
read of this surface: the service listing, the applications, the environment listing and aggregate,
the link query, and the deployment listing's tier check. **A new read endpoint joins it in the
commit that adds it; no write ever joins it** — a write's patience lives one layer down, below.

It is a bean the controllers call rather than a wrap inside `ServiceCatalog`/`EnvironmentService`,
and the reason is that those reads have callers that must not sleep. `ServiceCatalog.delete` calls
`require`, `allApplications` calls `list`, `EnvironmentService`'s `update`/`delete` call `require`,
and `ReleaseTips` reads the request rows from inside a `requiringNew` bracket under `claim`'s
`synchronized`. A retry inside the read would sleep holding a transaction, and there
holding a monitor. The worker's own reads are already wrapped at `CUTOVER_BUDGET`, so a wrap inside
would nest one budget in the other. (`ServiceCatalog.upsert` is `synchronized` as well, but it is a
write and no read shares its monitor.) `PdReadPatienceTest` holds both halves — recovered after one
lost connection, still a 500 when the database stays gone — off a stand-in repository installed with
`QuarkusMock`, under `DbPatienceShortProfile` so the deadline is reachable in a suite.

**The request-path WRITES are patient too, and their wrap is in the SERVICE — because it has to be
the transaction.** `inNewTx` only knows an attempt never committed if it owns the boundary, and the
boundary is in `EnvironmentService`, not in a controller. So `create`, `update` and `delete` each
*are* a `DbRetry.inNewTx` spending the same `db-retry-deadline` the reads do (a request thread, not
the worker's 30S), with validation left outside it — a rejected name is not worth a second attempt —
and a `flush()` as the body's last statement. `PdWritePatienceTest` holds both halves: an insert
whose connection dies *after* it ran lands **exactly once** on the second attempt, and a failure
that is not the connection is reported on the first.

`ServiceCatalog.upsert` is the one write wrapped from outside instead, and the two reasons are worth
keeping straight. It is `synchronized`, and a retry inside would sleep holding the catalogue's
monitor; the monitor has to enclose the commit, because the lock is what makes "is there a row for
this name yet" atomic. So the wrap sits on the REST door — the non-`synchronized` `upsert(Upsert)`
that already exists for causation — and it is `DbRetry.call`, safe because an upsert by name
converges rather than because the retry knows anything. **The worker's door `upsert(Upsert, UUID)`
stays bare**, with `queue`, `recordRejection` and the rest of derived registration: all of it runs
before anything docker-side has happened, where losing an event leaves nothing half-done.

## The observer: the second half of the eaa34fbc story

`DbRetry` fixed the **cause** above. It did nothing for the row: eaa34fbc still says `FAILED` while
`qits-pd-prod-qits-oci-postgresql-eaa34fbc` has been `Up (healthy)` for hours holding the
`prod-qits-oci-postgresql` alias, because a status was written once at deploy time and never read
back. `DeploymentObserver` is that second half, and the mirror image it also closes: an `ACTIVE` row
whose container died an hour after the gate passed, with nothing ever noticing.

- **It runs on the deploy worker**, enqueued by a bare daemon ticker (`pd-observation-ticker`) every
  `qits.platform.deployments.observe-interval-seconds` (30; `0` is off). Not quarkus-scheduler: the
  ticker's whole job is `worker.submit`, and a scheduler extension would put a second concurrency
  model beside a component whose entire ordering story is "one worker, in queue order". An observer
  thread of its own would take away the invariant serial execution buys — "the previous ACTIVE
  deployment is an uncontended read" — and could read the state between a cutover's own brackets. A
  tick that fires while one pass is already pending **collapses** into it (`observationPending`): an
  observation is a statement about now, so ten of them stacked behind a long deploy queue would all
  answer the same question.
- **It settles the LATEST row per (application, tier) only**, latest by `seq`. History stays history:
  an older `FAILED` row describes an attempt that really did fail, and today's healthy container says
  nothing about it. `QUEUED`/`STARTING` belong to the worker's state machine and to the startup sweep
  — a self-update sits in `STARTING` with a healthy successor **on purpose** —
  and `DECOMMISSIONED` is another deployment's decision.
- **`FAILED` or `GONE` → `ACTIVE`** when the container **the row itself names** is healthy by
  `HealthGate.healthy` (the gate's own verdict, extracted so there is one spelling of it). Only the
  row's own container: the seam asks by container **name**, never by alias, so a healthy container of
  somebody else's deployment cannot resurrect a foreign row. The detail **appends** — the original
  failure text is the diagnosis and is what made the bug findable in the first place.
- **`ACTIVE` → `GONE`** only when the container is **absent or terminally exited/dead**, and only
  when **two consecutive** passes agree. Both halves are the health gate's patience restated:
  restarting is not dead, running-but-unhealthy is not dead (that is the postgres-alias boot race the
  gate already tolerates), and one `docker inspect` that could not answer must not flip a deployment
  that is serving. The strike count is in memory on purpose — it is a debounce, not a fact, and a
  restart that loses it spends two more passes agreeing.
- **A recovery also decommissions the prior `ACTIVE` rows of that place.** The bookkeeping that died
  in eaa34fbc was one bracket doing two things, so a recovered row often has a predecessor still
  claiming to serve, and two `ACTIVE` rows for one (application, tier) is the invariant
  `listActiveByApplication` and the rollback pins are written around.
- **It writes rows and nothing else** — no container started, stopped or removed, no network touched.
  The sweep's "deliberately reaps no containers" stance, and it applies more strongly here: the sweep
  runs once at boot, this runs forever beside a live platform. Whatever still holds an alias is
  absorbed by the next deployment's predecessor search, which is where that decision belongs.
- The reads and the writes are `DbRetry`-wrapped for the same reason the cutover bookkeeping is: this
  is bookkeeping *after* a container is running, and one day a pass will run during a postgres
  self-cutover. The docker call sits between the two brackets, never inside one.

- **A place the orchestrator DECLARES empty is `SCALED_TO_ZERO`, not `GONE`, and there is no
  debounce on that arm.** See *Scale and restart* below: the desired replica count is asked only of
  a candidate that already looks dead, so a healthy platform pays nothing for it, and only a
  confident zero counts — a runtime that cannot answer still demotes, because an unreadable answer
  read as a deliberate stop would turn every outage into a pause nobody is paged for.

No ticker runs under a `@QuarkusTest` — `onStart` returns early in test mode — so the interval keeps
its shipped default in the suite and `PdDeploymentObservationTest` drives `observeOnce()` and
`enqueueObservation()` directly, the `PdSweepAdoptionTest` shape. That test also holds the serialization
claim, off the fake's call log: the pass's `observe:` calls land after the deployment's last one.

## Scale and restart: the operator's two levers (2026-09-04)

**qits-ci wedged and the only recovery was a same-sha push.** A disk-full incident orphaned its
in-memory dispatch queue — a state its own boot sweep clears in seconds — and the platform's one
lever for replacing a container was re-firing `environment/dev` so a rebuild and a redeploy would do
it: a quarter of an hour, a new deployment row and a fresh image build, to restart a process. So a
restart is an operation here now, and so is stopping an application:

    POST /platform-deployments/api/applications/{applicationId}/scale   {"replicas": 0|1}   → 202
    POST /platform-deployments/api/applications/{applicationId}/restart                      → 202

Eight things about it, each easy to undo by accident:

- **`applicationId` is the derived key the read surface already carries** — `<environmentId>:<name>`,
  `platform:<name>` — and `ApplicationKeys.parse` is its one inverse. The derivation was one-way for
  as long as the id was only ever a join key; a door that ACTS on an application has to turn it back
  into the `(application, tier)` pair the rows are keyed by.
- **The service the update is issued against comes off the deployment ROW** (`container_name`, which
  under swarm is the service's name and therefore its address) — never from the request. That is the
  same source `DeploymentObserver` takes it from and the same rule: nothing arriving over HTTP may
  shape an argv, and only the service a row named may be acted on for that row.
- **Everything runs on `pd-deploy-worker`** (`DeployService.enqueueOperation`), which is a
  correctness requirement rather than tidiness. A scale and a bounce are both
  `docker service update` on a service a deployment may be cutting over this second, and swarm's
  `UpdateStatus` holds the most recent update — an operator's restart issued from a request thread
  mid-cutover would be the status `awaitConverged` reads as that deployment's verdict. Hence 202,
  and hence the suite waits on `awaitIdle()`.
- **A restart writes NO status.** It stamps the row's `detail` and nothing else — the id, the sha,
  the container name, the timestamps and the history are untouched. That stamp is the whole audit
  trail, and it is deliberately not a row: a bounce is not an attempt to put a commit live. A new
  stamp **replaces** a previous one and keeps everything under it, so a script hammering the door
  cannot grow a text column and the deployment's own diagnosis is never lost.
- **A scale to 0 writes `SCALED_TO_ZERO`; a scale back up writes nothing** and leaves the row for
  the observation to promote. This component reaches a health verdict in exactly one place and it is
  `DeploymentObserver`; a scale that wrote `ACTIVE` would be claiming a gate it never ran. The wait
  is one `observe-interval-seconds` and that is the honest cost.
- **`MAX_REPLICAS` is 1, and it is the platform's shape rather than swarm's limit.** Every
  application here binds host ports from inside the task, or writes to a store with one writer, or
  holds a config volume. Raising it belongs in the commit that makes one of them able to run twice.
- **Scaling the deployer's own service to 0 is REFUSED by the driver**, naming why: there would be
  nothing left to scale it back up, and the API that would have done it is what stops answering.
  Scaling it up and bouncing it are allowed and come back `HANDED_OFF`, the self-deployment's own
  outcome and the same arbiter.
- **A deployment RESTATES `--replicas 1`**, which is new in `buildUpdateArgv` and is the one piece
  of desired state an update owns beside the image. A service left at 0 takes `service update
  --image` happily — swarm has no task to converge, so the update completes at once and the row is
  recorded `ACTIVE` with nothing running behind it. Mounts, networks and ports stay absent for the
  reason they always were: those are SHAPE, and this is state.

**The role is `qits-platform:admin`, the reader's**, and that is a decision rather than an
oversight: this is a person's operational action driven from this component's own client through the
edge's forwarded header. `qits-platform:system` is deliberately not granted — nothing on the
platform should be able to stop an application as a side effect of holding a service token, and the
two sets do not overlap. `MachineGuardEnforcedTest` arms it in both directions.

**Neither door announces an event**, and that is `DeploymentObserver`'s rule rather than an
omission: the four events describe a *deployment's* lifecycle, and a bounce is not one. A consumer
told `DeploymentActive` twice for one row would have to know the second statement supersedes the
first, which is a second design and is not this one. The routing snapshot is unchanged by either
action, so the edge has nothing to relearn.

**What is NOT on the read surface, and it is a decision.** There is no live replica count per row.
The status word carries the whole of what a client needs (`SCALED_TO_ZERO` is not `ACTIVE`, so a
stopped service does not render as a healthy one), and a `replicas` field would mean one
`docker service inspect` per row per listing — a read surface that shells out per row is a listing
that fails when the daemon is busy.

## One orchestrator, one seam

**Docker swarm, and nothing else.** The by-hand docker replace — find the alias holder, stop it, run
the successor, join it to every other network, poll the gate, roll back on failure — is deleted, and
`dockerhost/` with it. What is left is `swarmhost/SwarmDeploymentDriver`, the only implementation of
`DeploymentDriver`, resolved by ordinary injection.

**`qits.platform.deployments.orchestrator` survives as a GUARD**, not a choice:
`orchestration/DeploymentDrivers` fails the boot unless it says `swarm`. A deployment still carrying
`docker` from before the migration names an orchestrator this build does not have, and failing loudly
naming the key beats deploying the platform with whatever is left. `DeploymentDriversTest` holds it.

**The deployment half of the seam is two verbs**: `apply(ServiceSpec)` makes the described service
exist at the described image, `awaitConverged(name, timeout)` says whether it took. `start`, `stop`,
the container-level `restart`, `connect`,
`disconnect`, `aliasHolders`, `handoff`, `isSelf` and `containerId` went when the second
orchestrator arrived — every one of them is a statement about how *docker* replaces a container, and
keeping them would have made one orchestrator's model look like the contract. **Do not put a
mechanic back on this seam**: `pull` and `networks` are the two verbs here that are not
swarm-shaped, and each is kept for what it ANSWERS (is anything published; what is the membership),
never for how.

**Three verbs beside them are the OPERATOR's, and they are not the mechanics coming back** —
`desiredReplicas`, `scale` and `restart(serviceName)`; see *Scale and restart* below. The test the
removed verbs failed is the one to keep applying: none of these three is a step somebody sequences
to perform a deployment. Each states an outcome a person asked for, and nothing calls two of them in
a row.

**So `DeployService.execute` has no branches in it**: resolve → provision → pull (for the
`IMAGE_MISSING` classification) → `apply` → `awaitConverged` → record. What stayed with it is the
bookkeeping: the row per place, the four announcements, the cutover bracket, and the reap **after**
the rows (`Convergence.retired()` comes back as data for exactly that reason).

Three things about the shape, each easy to undo by accident:

- **`nameOf(spec)` is asked before `apply`**, and it is the wire alias: a swarm service's name IS
  its address, so a replace is an update of that same service and both rows of a cutover name it.
  `ServiceSpec.deploymentName` still carries the container-shaped `qits-pd-<env>-<app>-<id8>`,
  because that is what a person greps the host for — it is not the name of anything.
- **`ApplyOutcome.HANDED_OFF` is neither success nor failure.** A deployment that replaces this very
  process leaves its row `STARTING` on purpose; the instance that survives records it, from
  `runningImage`.
- **`FakeDeploymentDriver` is the suite's `@Mock`**, at `DeploymentDriver` itself, and that is where
  it belongs now: there is no choreography above the CLI left to exercise through a booted
  application. What a deployment does to a daemon is `SwarmDeploymentDriverTest`, plain JUnit over
  the package-private `Cli` seam, one argv at a time.

**Under swarm the topology is flat and that is a decision, not a simplification**: every
`--network-add` recreates the task, so a service declares its whole membership at create time —
`qits.platform.deployments.swarm.flat-network` (an *attachable* overlay, which is what keeps CI
step, workspace and agent containers working on it) plus `qits-platform` for the plane. The
per-application networks the state machine still computes are dropped by the swarm driver, out
loud. A service update keeps the mounts, networks and ports it was created with: changing the shape
of a service is a `service rm` and a redeploy, not a deployment.

### Network aliases: the vhost names docker's DNS cannot make up

**`qits.platform.deployments.extras.<app>.aliases[N]`** is a plain DNS name the application also
answers to on the **shared** network — the flat overlay every service joins. It exists because the
edge proxy carries the platform's vhost names (`registry.dev.localhost` and its siblings) and
docker's embedded DNS **cannot synthesize a `*.localhost`**: a container asking for one gets
NXDOMAIN unless the edge holds the name as a network alias. It is deployment config rather than a
repository's spec for the reason the rest of the family is — where a name resolves is a property of
the platform, not of the code.

Four things about the rendering, each easy to undo by accident:

- **With no aliases the argv is byte-identical to what it always was**: `--network <net>`, the short
  form. One alias or more turns *that one attachment* into the long form, `--network
  name=<net>,alias=<a1>,alias=<a2>`. `aServiceWithNoAliasesGetsTheShortFormItAlwaysGot` pins it —
  the two spellings mean the same thing to swarm, so nothing but the test keeps the diff honest.
- **Only the shared network carries them.** An alias is an address and has to be on the network the
  platform's names resolve on; `qits-platform` and anything else a spec declares keep the short form.
- **Aliases with no shared network to hold them are a REFUSED deployment**, the publish-with-an-ip
  stance: a name asked for and quietly not registered is a peer resolving nothing, hours later and
  somewhere else.
- **`buildUpdateArgv` stays network-free, so an alias change is not a deployment** — the ports
  doctrine exactly. Swarm has no add-an-alias and `--network-add` of a network the service is
  already on is an error, so a live service gains or loses one by hand (`service update --network-rm
  <net> --network-add name=<net>,alias=…`, which recreates the task) or by a `service rm` and a
  redeploy. A declared alias reaches a service only on its next **create**.

**`update_order` in `.config/qits/deployments.yml`** is `start-first` (default) or `stop-first`, per
repository, and only the repository knows: a published host port, a single-writer store or a held
config volume each make the overlap impossible. This repo says `stop-first`. It reaches the
orchestrator as `--update-order`.

**`publish_mode` is the second such key** — `host` (default, today's behaviour byte for byte) or
`ingress`, per repository. Host mode binds the port from inside the task, so two tasks cannot
overlap and the service also needs `stop-first`; ingress hands the port to swarm's routing mesh,
which keeps holding it while a successor starts, so an ingress service may keep `start-first` and
its lossless rollback. It reaches the orchestrator as `mode=` on the publish, and it means nothing
to an application that publishes no port. **Nothing derives one key from the other**: an ingress
service that says `stop-first` gets `stop-first`. The mode is part of a service's SHAPE, so an
existing service keeps the mode it was created with until a `service rm` and a redeploy — an
update never restates ports. And, like every spec key: **it must ship in the deployer before any
repository writes the line**, since a spec is read at the released tag and an unknown key fails a
deployment.

### The registry credential, and the outcome it used to be mistaken for

**`qits.platform.deployments.registry-auth`** (boolean, `false` shipped) adds
`--with-registry-auth` to the service **create and the update alike**. The flag serialises the
CLI's stored credential into the service SPEC, which is what the swarm agent pulls with; without
it only this component's own warm-up `docker pull` is authenticated — that one runs as this
process, with this process's `DOCKER_CONFIG` — and the task's node-side pull carries nothing. It
is a key rather than always-on because registry reads are anonymous today, so there would be
nothing to serialise; unset, both argvs are what they were byte for byte. **The credential itself
is env wiring**: the container runs as uid 1001 with no HOME, so a deployment points
`DOCKER_CONFIG` at a mounted `config.json`. No code here writes, reads or logs it. It does not
conflict with `--no-resolve-image` — one says do not turn the tag into a digest, the other hands
the agents a credential for a later pull.

**An auth refusal is `PullOutcome.AUTH_REFUSED`, and it is a `FAILED` deployment naming the
credential.** It was `IMAGE_MISSING`, which sent an operator to a pipeline that had published
perfectly well. The two marker lists are asked in **order and the order is the whole point**:
docker's refusal reads `pull access denied for <image>, repository does not exist or may require
'docker login'`, so it carries a missing-image marker inside it and a first-match-wins list would
keep calling a refusal a missing image. `IMAGE_MISSING` keeps its narrowed meaning — the registry
answered and has no such tag (`manifest unknown`, `not found`, `name unknown`). Anything neither
list recognises is still `ERROR`.

**The startup sweep settles an in-flight row from what is RUNNING** (`DeploymentDriver.runningImage`,
one read per `STARTING` row that named something): the image carrying the row's sha is `ACTIVE` with
the prior actives of that place decommissioned, another sha is `SUPERSEDED` (swarm's `UpdateStatus`
supplies the wording), and no such service is the interrupted-by-a-restart `FAILED` every other
in-flight row takes. The **image** is the check and `UpdateStatus` is only wording: that
field holds the most recent update, so a later deployment overwrites the verdict of the one a row is
about. It replaced "is this row's name me", which cannot tell a completed succession from a
rolled-back one — under swarm the service keeps its name across both.

### `UpdateStatus` does not say WHICH update, and `awaitConverged` had to (2026-08-13)

The sweep's caution above is the whole story, and reading the field *during* a cutover was the same
mistake in a worse place. `service update --detach` returns before the daemon has replaced
`UpdateStatus`, so the first poll after an update reads either the **previous** cutover's terminal
state or, in the window where swarm has cleared it, **nothing at all**. Both were read as an answer.
Measured on qits-docs: the deployer logged "Deployed" 43ms after issuing the update, off a
`completed` an earlier deployment had left, wrote the row `ACTIVE` with an empty detail and
decommissioned the predecessor that was serving — while swarm spent the next 25 seconds rolling the
successor back (`rollback_completed`, and the row never said so).

So the driver records, per service name, **when it issued the update**, and matches
`.UpdateStatus.StartedAt` against it. Four things hold it up:

- **`apply` and `awaitConverged` land on one `@ApplicationScoped` bean**, which is the carry the
  retired docker driver used for its in-flight cutover state. The map is written only on the update
  arm (a create has no `UpdateStatus` to confuse and *clears* the key), pruned on write, and
  consumed by the verdict in a `finally` — an issue instant that outlived its answer would make the
  next question about that service wait for an update nobody issued.
- **A status older than the issue instant, an empty status and an unreadable stamp are all
  PENDING** — never a verdict, never a crash. In particular the empty arm no longer falls through
  to the task check: under `start-first` the *predecessor's* task is still `Running`, so that
  fallback answered "converged" about the deployment being replaced. It stays what it always was
  for a **fresh create**, where there is no predecessor to mistake.
- **The tolerance is 5s and the asymmetry is the argument.** In real time the daemon stamps
  `StartedAt` after the CLI returned, so only clock skew can make this deployment's own status look
  early — milliseconds on one host, a second or two for a remote daemon. What it must reject is the
  *previous cutover*, which is minutes to months away. Nothing plausible sits between.
- **The deadline still bounds everything.** An update whose status never appears fails at the health
  timeout with a detail naming what was last seen, rather than passing.

**The timestamp has two spellings and only one of them is RFC3339** — measured on docker 29.7.2:
`service inspect --format` prints Go's own `time.Time.String()`
(`2026-08-13 10:21:12.655795838 +0000 UTC`), while the JSON body of the same inspect says
`2026-08-13T10:21:12.655795838Z`. `parseStartedAt` takes both and answers null to everything else
(`<nil>`, `<no value>`), which is what makes an unreadable stamp patience instead of an exception.
`UPDATE_STATUS_FORMAT` is `State|StartedAt|Message` in that order for one reason: the message is
free text from the daemon and is read as the remainder of the line, so a field behind it would be
whatever the message left over. `RUNNING_IMAGE_FORMAT` embeds it and its parser skips the stamp.

## FAILED was five outcomes, and now it is one

`PdDeploymentStatus` is the single source of the words — an entity enum, a `varchar(32)` with **no
check constraint** (V1 says why), so the vocabulary grows without a migration and every historical
row keeps the word it was written with. **Nothing is backfilled and nothing is relabelled.**

Three of the five outcomes `FAILED` used to cover have their own word, one writer each:

| status | meaning | written by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ROLLED_BACK` | the successor never converged and the orchestrator put the predecessor back — it is serving | `DeployService.execute`, off `ConvergenceOutcome.ROLLED_BACK` |
| `SUPERSEDED` | a restart interrupted this in-flight row and a newer sha is serving its place | the startup sweep's verdict |
| `GONE` | a formerly `ACTIVE` row whose container two observation passes found absent | `DeploymentObserver.demote` |
| `SCALED_TO_ZERO` | the workload is **deliberately stopped** — somebody scaled the application to 0 | `ApplicationScaling` on the operator's own action, and `DeploymentObserver.pause` for a scale performed by hand |
| `FAILED` | the attempt ended and **nothing is known to serve the place** | everything else — refused apply, image pull error, convergence failure with no rollback, interrupted row with no successor |

Four things that are decisions rather than details:

- **The driver already knew.** `awaitConverged` has returned a distinct `ROLLED_BACK` verdict since
  the swarm migration; `execute` flattened it to `FAILED` on `!converged.converged()`. The refinement
  is reading the answer that was already there.
- **The four events stay four.** A `ROLLED_BACK` outcome still announces `DeploymentFailed` —
  consumers care that it did not go live — and rides the record's existing `status` **string**, which
  is exactly what a string on the wire was for. No vocabulary-jar change, no `EventWireReflection`
  entry. `SUPERSEDED` and `GONE` announce nothing, because the sweep and the observer announce
  nothing.
- **`GONE` recovers.** The observer's `FAILED` → `ACTIVE` arm heals `GONE` too: a demotion that
  self-heals must heal whatever word the demotion wrote, or the observation could write a status it
  could never take back.
- **The rollback pins are untouched, and that is verified rather than assumed.** `RollbackPins.SERVED`
  is `{ACTIVE, DECOMMISSIONED}` and the serving scan keys on `ACTIVE` — a demoted row was excluded as
  `FAILED` before the word existed and is excluded as `GONE` now. Same for `listActiveByApplication`
  and the sweep's `listByStatus(QUEUED|STARTING)`: every status query here is a **positive** list, so
  a new word leaks into none of them. Keep it that way — a `status != ACTIVE` filter would be the
  regression.

## The health gate is patient, and that is not a tuning choice

`HealthGate` (in `deployments/control`, polled by the driver) ends early on exactly two verdicts:
**healthy**, and a container docker cannot inspect at all. **Restarting is PENDING. Running-but-
unhealthy is PENDING.** The deadline — `qits.platform.deployments.health-timeout-seconds`, unchanged
— is what fails a deployment, and the verdict then reads `container still <state> after <n>s` with
the log tail under it.

The reason is structural rather than generous. `docker run` takes **one** network, so a fresh
container starts on its primary one and every other join happens after the start
(`DeployService.join`). A PostgreSQL-backed application runs Flyway immediately, cannot resolve the
postgres wire alias yet, and dies with an acquisition timeout; `--restart unless-stopped` brings it
back seconds later into a world where the joins are done, and the second boot works. The old gate
read `restarting/unhealthy` once and failed the deployment 18 seconds in — measured on
qits-platform-idp's first PostgreSQL deployment. H2-era applications could never hit it, which is
why the instant fail survived this long.

**The race itself left with the docker path**: a swarm service declares its whole membership when
it is created, so a first boot never runs before its peers are addressable. What survives is the
patience, and it survives where it still applies — `HealthGate.healthy` is the one reading
`DeploymentObserver` settles a row on, so restarting and running-but-unhealthy are not a dead
deployment there either.

`HealthGate.await`, the polling loop itself, **has no caller left** and says so in its own javadoc.
It was the docker cutover's; swarm reaches its own verdict through `UpdateStatus`.

## The vocabulary rename, and the alias

`singleton` → `platform`, everywhere: `PdDeploymentTarget.PLATFORM`, label
`qits.platform.deployments.target=platform`, network `qits-platform` (unchanged name), key stand-in
`platform:<name>` in `ApplicationKeys`.

**`deployment_target: singleton` remains an accepted alias in the spec parser and nowhere else.** It
parses to `PLATFORM` and nothing downstream can tell the two apart; the error message for an
unrecognised value names only `environment` and `platform`, so a repository being corrected is
pointed at the word to use. Do not add the alias to the API, the enum or the labels — it exists so a
repository that has not been edited yet keeps deploying across the cutover, not as a second spelling
to maintain.

**The config namespace is `qits.platform.deployments.*`** — `platform` qualifies `deployments`, it
is not half of one word. It was `qits.cd.*` in the ancestor and `qits.pd.*` for one release here; a
deployment carrying an old spelling configures nothing and fails loudly at boot (SmallRye rejects an
unsatisfied `@ConfigProperty`), which is the intended failure. The env form is
`QITS_PLATFORM_DEPLOYMENTS_*` — every wrapper and compose file that injects config moves with it.
The one family read in the DOTTED spelling only is `qits.platform.deployments.extras.<app>.*`, and
`ServiceExtras` says why: an underscore cannot tell `qits-ci`'s keys from `qits-ci-daemon`'s.

## Adopting what qits-cd left behind

The labels are `qits.platform.deployments.*`. Two earlier spellings exist on the host — `qits.cd.*`
from the retired ancestor and `qits.pd.*` from this component before the namespace was written out
in full. **Nothing here reads either, and nothing should start to.** A holder with no
`qits.platform.deployments.environment` label is unclaimed — a compose original, a bootstrap seed, a
qits-cd container, a container this component started before the rename — and unclaimed means
*adoptable predecessor*. Reading a legacy label would make those containers look like another tier's
and leave them running beside their replacements, which is the one failure the cutover exists to
prevent.

The container **name** prefix is `qits-pd-` (the ancestor's was `qits-cd-`), and it **stays short
through the namespace rename**: docker's name charset has no dot, and
`qits-platform-deployments-<env>-<app>-<id8>` spends 26 characters before the two words a person
actually reads. So it is the namespace's abbreviation, spelled once in `ContainerNames`. It is how a
person reads the host and what a bootstrap greps; it is never how a predecessor is found (that is
the alias). Wrapper and component changes land together.

## Names, and the one that is an address

Two derived shapes, and only one of them resolves:

| | environment | platform |
| --- | --- | --- |
| container name (`ContainerNames`) | `qits-pd-<env>-<app>-<id8>` | `qits-pd-<app>-<id8>` |
| wire alias (`PdNetworks.alias`) | `<env>-<app>` | `<app>` |

**Both are asked which PLANE they are on, and neither reads it off a missing tier any more.** Both
take a `PdDeploymentTarget`, because a platform service is deployed INTO the designated environment
and therefore has an environment name to be qualified by — one that must not reach either shape.
The regression is not cosmetic: a swarm service's NAME is the wire alias, and swarm cannot rename a
service, so an alias that started carrying `dev-` would create `dev-qits-ci` **beside**
`qits-ci` and leave every peer dialling a name nothing answers to.

**The wire alias is the address, and it is derived in one place because everything that has to
agree about an address takes it from here** — swarm's service name first of all, which is also what
makes a replace an update rather than a second service.

The environment qualifier exists because the flat overlay is shared by every tier: without it two
tiers' copies of one application hold the same address there. A platform service keeps the bare
name — it serves every tier, so a consumer must be able to reach it without knowing which one the
plane runs in — and the platform applications carry the plane in their own names
(`qits-platform-idp`), which is also why the platform container name **drops** the segment rather
than filling it with the word.

**This is the one fact about the plane that survived "a platform service is deployed to the main
environment".** The row, the labels, `QITS_ENVIRONMENT` and all four events name the designated
tier now; the address does not, and `PdNetworks.platformAlias` is where that is spelled.

## Networks are docker's bookkeeping, never a row

Hub and spoke, as README describes. Two things to leave alone unless you mean it:

- **`aliasHolders` searches the union** of every network the fresh container will be on, legacy one
  included. Narrow it and a deploy starts a second copy beside a container that holds its alias on
  `qits-net` alone — which is every container on the platform until it has been redeployed once.
- **…and the union is then filtered by the holder's `qits.platform.deployments.environment`**, the
  other half of the same thought. The legacy network is shared by every tier, so the union also returns another tier's
  healthy copy of the same application under the same alias; stopping that would be one tier reaching
  into another. This tier's label → predecessor; another tier's → left alone; **unlabelled** →
  adoptable. (Both bullets are the **retired docker driver's**, kept because the reasoning is what
  `legacy-network` still rests on. Under swarm there is no predecessor search at all: a service is
  found by NAME, the name is the wire alias, and a platform service's alias is bare — which is
  exactly what makes the existing fleet's platform services be UPDATED in place by the first
  deployment under the new code rather than duplicated beside it. No label filtering is involved,
  and the pre-change containers need no adoption arm because they were never a different service.)
- **A join asked for and not granted FAILS the deployment.** `docker network connect` reports
  "already there" as an error, so the driver tells that wording apart from a refusal and only the
  refusal counts. It has to fail rather than warn: the health gate curls localhost *inside* the
  container, so it passes perfectly well on a network nobody else is on, and the cutover would then
  remove the predecessor under an unreachable successor. The *reconciliation's* joins stay
  best-effort — those are a self-heal, not this deployment's own reachability.
- **`qits.platform.deployments.legacy-network`** (default `qits-net`, `Optional<String>` because
  SmallRye reads an empty value as absent) is the transition membership. **Emptying it is the enforcement flip**, a
  later phase that needs every direct cross-application URL migrated first. `LegacyNetworkOffTest`
  already runs that posture. An environment teardown never disconnects anything from it and never
  removes it, even when it IS that environment's bundle — which is exactly the dev tier's shape.

## Untrusted input

Two validators, split by the module boundary rather than by taxonomy:

- **`PdIdentifiers`** (`environments`) — names, branches, health paths, resource names, database
  names: what the topology **stores**, checked where it is stored. Names become docker network
  names, aliases and image path segments, so the charset is the dns-label one.
- **`DeploymentIdentifiers`** (`deployments`) — shas, repository ids, repository names and their
  project ids, run ids, resource-attribute values: what only ever reaches an argv or the spec
  read's URL, checked beside it.

**The health path is the strictest and stays that way.** It is the one value interpolated into a
string a *shell inside the container* runs (`--health-cmd`), so it gets an allowlist, no exceptions,
and is re-checked at the last line before the argv (`SwarmDeploymentDriver.healthFlags`). Three
callers use the same check: the API, the spec parser (repository-authored input) and the argv.

**`health_cmd` is the one value with no charset, and the exception proves the rule.** It is not
interpolated into a shell string — it *is* the string, chosen by a repository for its own
container, so an allowlist would refuse the probes worth writing (`pg_isready -U postgres || exit
1`) while granting nothing: the image's entrypoint is already that repository's, and the command is
one argv element to `ProcessBuilder`, never re-split. `DeploymentIdentifiers.requireHealthCmd`
bounds it to one non-blank line of 512 characters, at the parser and again at the argv. It
**replaces** `health_path` (the parser fails a file setting both), so the path is neither used nor
checked when a command is present. It is not stored: the spec is read before every deployment, and
the one path that resolves targets from the catalogue instead records failures and deploys nothing.

**`resources:` takes the health-path treatment, and it needs one checkpoint more than the health
path does.** Both halves of an entry are repository-authored. The **resource name** becomes an
environment-variable key on a `docker run` (`QITS_RESOURCE_<NAME>_URL`), which is the health path's
situation exactly. The **database name** additionally lands in DDL run against a postgres instance
**the whole platform shares** — and DDL has no bind variables, so the allowlist is not a belt there,
it is the only guard. Hence `requireResourceName` (`[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,31}`) and
`requireDatabaseName` (`qits_[a-z0-9_]{1,58}`), and three checkpoints rather than two: the parser,
the line before the SQL string is assembled, and the argv. The mandatory `qits_` prefix is the
structural half of the guard — it excludes `postgres`, `template0/1` and every `pg_*` name by
construction, so the namespace a repository can reach is disjoint from the instance's own.

**What a repository can NAME versus what this component INJECTS.** A repository names a database of
its own; every VALUE that reaches the container for it — the url, the role, the password — is
derived or generated here. So the rule that nothing arriving over HTTP contributes a credential to a
`docker run` is unchanged by provisioning: the credential is this component's, and the registry row
is its only copy.

**Provisioning speaks SQL, not shell.** `CREATE ROLE` / `CREATE DATABASE` / `REVOKE` / `ALTER …
OWNER` over plain JDBC — no `psql`, no `docker exec`, no process. `exec` is still not in the docker
vocabulary and must not enter it. The postgres superuser password comes from
`qits.platform.deployments.postgres.admin-password` (deployment config, the domain that already
holds the socket), has no default, is never stored in a row and never reaches an argv. **There is no
`DROP` and none is coming**: marking a resource obsolete is future work, and it will be a mark.

**The `platformdeployments` database is credential-bearing.** `pd_resource.password` is the single
authority for every provisioned application's credential. Treat it with the sensitivity of the
`qits-deployments-config` volume. No statement containing a password is logged, no failure detail
names one, and `PgResourceProvisioner.literal` refuses a password it could not quote safely rather
than escaping it cleverly.

Argvs are assembled for `ProcessBuilder`, which never re-splits — but do not lean on that:
validation stays at the boundary and the belt stays at the argv.

Mounts, published ports, groups, network aliases and extra env in a *started* container's argv come
from the **deployment's own config and nowhere else** (`qits.platform.deployments.extras.<application>.*`,
read by `ServiceExtras`). **Nothing PUSHED over HTTP may contribute to a `docker run`**; this
component's own API is deliberately open on the platform's networks, so nothing arriving on it may
shape an argv. `ServiceExtrasTest.anotherApplicationsKeysAreNeverRead`, plus
`extrasOfAnotherApplicationDoNotLeakIn` on **both** driver tests, asserts the absence as the
security property. A `docker exec` is the regression, and so is anything the intake can reach.

**The word is PUSHED, and it narrowed on purpose when qits-configuration landed.** The extras may
now be PULLED — this process, with its own machine identity, reading a named service it was
configured to trust (see the extras-url section below). That changes the source and not the guard:
nothing pushes config into a deployment, no caller of this component's API can name a key, and the
url is deployment config like everything else. The consequence to carry is that
**qits-configuration is credential-bearing infrastructure** — treat its database and its write
surface with the sensitivity of the `qits-deployments-config` volume.

**The family is typed, and an unknown or malformed key is a refused deployment** — never a warning
and a dropped flag, which is a container that boots, passes its gate and has lost its volume.

**And it is read PER ARGV, not out of the boot config** (`ExtrasSnapshot`, `deployments/control`).
Quarkus' config-dir source reads `<user.dir>/config/application.properties` once, at boot, so an
edit on the deployment host's config volume was inert until the process was replaced — and every
deployment re-stamped the boot snapshot onto the service it updated, which reverted a live
`service update --env-add` fix on 2026-08-16 and cost a day. Both argv builders take **one**
snapshot — that file layered over the boot config, at a higher ordinal — and hand it to every
reading, because `ServiceExtras` rests on "every reading agrees" and that is only true of a fixed
`Config`. `qits.platform.deployments.extras-file` names the path. **Absent is the boot config
itself**, byte for byte what a dev run and the clone-alone suite always had; **present and
unreadable is a REFUSED deployment naming the path**, because a fall-back to boot values is the
stale value the whole thing exists to kill and would ship a green deployment carrying it.

### The file is the cold-boot source, and qits-configuration is the source

**`qits.platform.deployments.extras-url` is optional and UNSET SHIPPED**, and unset is the file
behaviour above byte for byte: no request, no parse, nothing to configure. Set — a deployment sends
`QITS_PLATFORM_DEPLOYMENTS_EXTRAS_URL=http://dev-qits-configuration:8080` — **that service is
AUTHORITATIVE**, read once per argv build at
`GET <url>/configuration/api/applications/<application>/resolved`, whose `properties` map arrives in
the full `qits.platform.deployments.extras.<app>.*` spelling. `ServiceExtras` stays the single
parser of the grammar — nothing in `confighost` translates a key.

**AUTHORITATIVE MEANS SOLE, and that is the 2026-08-17 correction.** With the url set the file is
**not read at all**: the served map over this process's boot config is the whole snapshot. It was
layered *above* the file for one release, on the reasoning that a half-migrated platform should keep
deploying applications whose keys had not moved yet — which read well and deployed badly. A key
**deleted** from the service came straight back out of a file nobody had emptied (measured: a
revision serving 2 properties, the file's stale third still winning at ordinal 1000), so the one
operation the service exists to make possible was the one it could not perform. Two sources cannot
both be authoritative, and the one left on a volume is the stale one by construction.

**The rollback is the key itself**: empty `extras-url` and the file is the source again — but it may
be months out of date by then, so re-render or export it before leaning on it.

Five things about it, each easy to undo by accident:

- **The seam is `DeploymentExtrasSource`, in `deployments/`, and the HTTP is
  `confighost/ConfigHostExtrasSource`, in `service/`.** The driver injects the seam and no longer
  knows what a config file is. **One call is one snapshot**, which is the invariant `ServiceExtras`
  rests on; calling it twice for one argv is the bug the shape exists to prevent, and both argv
  builders call it exactly once.
- **An unreachable or non-200 service REFUSES the deployment**, naming the url, and there is
  **deliberately no fall-back** — not to the file, not to the boot config, not to anything read
  earlier. A stale extras value is the failure that cost 2026-08-16 and it ships invisibly, as a
  green deployment. The refusal is a `ServiceExtras.Refused`, so it reaches the row through the
  driver's existing refusal arm with nothing created.
- **A 404 is NOT an answer here**, and that is the one place this differs from the spec read. A
  repository with no `deployments.yml` really does deploy with the defaults; an application
  qits-configuration has never heard of is an application whose extras this deployment cannot know
  it is missing.
- **The patience is two keys and a bounded budget** — `extras-timeout-seconds` (5) and
  `extras-attempts` (2, spent a second apart). A service being redeployed is a few seconds of
  refusals and no deployment should die of one; an outage that outlasts the budget must be a loud
  refusal rather than an unbounded wait on `pd-deploy-worker`, which is single-threaded with every
  other event queued behind it. **A body that will not parse is never retried** — it will not parse
  a second time either.
- **The credential is the named oidc client and its switch is the extension's own.**
  `quarkus.oidc-client.configuration.client-enabled` is false shipped, and off the read carries the
  `X-Qits-User`/`X-Qits-Roles` pair alone — the posture of a platform running qits-configuration
  behind forward-auth on qits-net during the migration. There is no key of ours beside it, so two
  spellings cannot disagree; the deployment-side family is `QUARKUS_OIDC_CLIENT_CONFIGURATION_*`,
  the sibling shape qits-workspaces uses for its git-host client. **The default (unnamed) client is
  disabled in `application.properties` and must stay disabled**: the extension creates it whether or
  not anything injects it, and an enabled one with no `auth-server-url` fails the boot naming a key
  nobody meant to set.

**What is NOT recorded, and it is an open debt rather than an omission.** The read logs
`config-revision=<headRevision>` at INFO beside the url, and that is the only place the revision a
deployment was configured with is written down. It does not reach the deployment row's `detail`:
that is written by `DeployService` out of the driver's verdict, and the extras are read a layer
below the driver, so a revision could only ride there by widening `ApplyResult` and the seam's
return type together. Worth doing the day the row's detail is asked to carry more than the
orchestrator's own words.

This component's own env flags (`QITS_ENVIRONMENT`, `QITS_APPLICATION`, `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`
and its `QUARKUS_`-spelled twin) are written **before** the deployment's own, and docker keeps the
**last** assignment of a repeated key — measured, not assumed. So they are defaults an operator
overrides, and the ordering is the precedence rule: never reorder them past the extras.

### An update states removals now, and a hand `--env-add` no longer survives one

`buildUpdateArgv` only ever `--env-add`ed, so a variable **removed** from an application's extras
stayed on the live service until somebody removed the service — measured on 2026-08-17, on the
deployment that proved the flip: the entry was deleted, the deploy went green, the stale env kept
serving. So the update reads the live service's own environment
(`docker service inspect --format {{range .Spec.TaskTemplate.ContainerSpec.Env}}…`, the inspect
pattern the rest of the driver already uses) and emits `--env-rm` for every key on it that nothing
in this argv states.

**Read the consequence as the feature, because it is the campaign's whole point:** an operator's
`docker service update --env-add` on a live service is now REVERTED by the next deployment of that
application. State moves to qits-configuration; a fix applied to a container is a fix that lives
until somebody deploys. That is the trade the demotion buys — a config value has one home instead of
two, and the one that wins is the one that is written down.

**What is never removed is a family, not a list of exceptions**, and it has three members:

- **everything this argv states** — the extras' own `env`, which is the whole of what config says;
- **`DEPLOYER_OWN_VARIABLES`** — `QITS_ENVIRONMENT`, `QITS_APPLICATION`, `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`
  and its `QUARKUS_` twin, this component's identity set. It writes them on every argv and config
  states none of them, so a diff against config alone would remove and re-add all four every time;
- **anything under `QITS_RESOURCE_`** — `ResourceProvisioning` injects those from the registry row,
  which is the single authority for the credential. Config cannot state a provisioned password and
  must not be able to delete one.

Four more things, each easy to undo by accident:

- **Only an UPDATE diffs.** A create has no predecessor and `service create` has no such flag.
- **An inspect that cannot answer removes NOTHING**, with a WARN. Losing an application's whole
  environment because one CLI call failed is a worse failure than carrying a stale key one more
  deployment, and the next deployment asks again.
- **A line with no `=` is skipped**: an env VALUE may contain a newline, so a wrapped line is a
  continuation rather than a key — and `--env-rm` of a name that is not there is a refused
  deployment, not a no-op.
- **The removals are sorted**, so one deployment's argv is the same argv twice and two run logs
  diff cleanly.

**The deployer's own self-update is the regression to watch, and it is pinned by a test.** Its
extras carry the flip — `QITS_PLATFORM_DEPLOYMENTS_EXTRAS_URL` and the
`QUARKUS_OIDC_CLIENT_CONFIGURATION_*` credential the read presents — so they survive because they
ARE extras. A deployer that env-rm'd its own extras-url mid-self-deploy would come back reading the
file it was demoted from, silently, on a green deployment.
`theDeployersOwnSelfUpdateKeepsTheKeysThatPointItAtQitsConfiguration` holds it. **Anything the seed
stack sets on the deployer and the extras do not state is removed on its first self-deploy** — which
is why cli-bootstrap spells the deployer's `QITS_PLATFORM_DEPLOYMENTS_*` variables in both places.

## Resources: what the deployer provisions, and where the truth is

A repository's `resources: postgresql:<name>[:<database>]` is answered before the pull, by
`ResourceProvisioning` over the `ResourceProvisioner` seam. Four things decide how it behaves and
each is easy to undo by accident:

- **The registry row is the single authority for the credential.** `pd_resource.password` is not a
  cache of something postgres knows — postgres stores a hash — and no file carries it. That is what
  makes the drift arms decidable: a row without a role is a reset postgres volume and the role comes
  back with the **stored** password (running containers keep working); a role without a row is a
  reset deployer database and the role is rotated to a **fresh** one (nothing knew the old one).
  Never a `DROP`, in either direction.
- **This component is adopter #1 and cannot provision itself from cold**, which is what
  `BootResourceRegistration` exists for: the bootstrap creates its roles and databases over plain
  JDBC before the process exists, and the rows are written from the environment at every boot.
  Without them the first self-deploy takes the reconcile arm and rotates the passwords its own
  connection pools are holding open.

  **An absent `QITS_ENVIRONMENT` is RESOLVED, not read as a plane.** It used to mean "the platform
  plane" — the swarm driver wrote the variable for environment applications only, and the rows went
  in under a null tier, which was the key `ResourceProvisioning` looked a platform service's rows up
  by. A platform service is deployed into the designated environment now and is started with the
  variable like everything else, so the absence means exactly one thing: **this container was
  started by the previous code**, in the window between the deploy that ships the change and the one
  after it. `BootResourceRegistration.environmentName()` then reads `pd_environment.platform` — the
  same designation the deploying instance used to choose where to put this container — and records
  under that name, which is the key the next self-deploy looks it up by. Recording null there would
  send that deploy down the reconcile arm and rotate both passwords this process's pools are holding
  open. Null survives only as the last resort, with a WARN, on an install with no tier designated at
  all.

  **It declares TWO resources now** — `db` (this component's registry) and `eventstream` (the bus
  client's claim ledger and outbox, a store of its own with its own Flyway lineage) — so
  `BootResourceRegistration` records both, over `RESOURCES`. A third entry in
  `.config/qits/deployments.yml` is a third line there and nothing else. **The resource NAMES are
  load-bearing**: the variables follow the name (`QITS_RESOURCE_<NAME>_URL` and its two siblings)
  and the jar that owns each store reads exactly those in its own shipped defaults, so renaming one
  here silently stops matching.

  **Self-provisioning works for everything after the first container**, and that is worth being
  precise about because this component is its own deployer: the spec is read at the released tag, so
  the *running* instance reads the new `resources:` line, creates the role and the database, and
  injects the triple into the successor it starts. Only a cold bootstrap has no deployer to do it,
  which is why the bootstrap's generated config carries both triples. A missing one is not a degraded boot —
  the jars' expressions have no defaults, so the process dies at Flyway naming what is absent, and
  the health gate leaves the predecessor serving.
- **No transaction spans the seam call.** The registry read and the row upsert are two
  `requiringNew()` brackets with the DDL between them — a socket to another server must never sit
  inside this component's own transaction.
- **The host is derived, never configured.** An environment application uses
  `PdNetworks.alias(<tier>, "qits-oci-postgresql")`; a platform-plane one uses the platform
  environment's tier, and fails with a sentence when no environment is designated. There is no
  postgres-host config key and there should not be one.

The admin credential and the untrusted-input rules for the two names are in **Untrusted input**
above. `PgResourceProvisionerTest` runs the matrix against a real postgres because the arms differ
only in which statement runs — a fake there would be asserting the test's own model of the server.

## Addressing and auth

`quarkus.rest.path=/platform-deployments/api` lives in the service module's
`application.properties` and the suite inherits it — a resource's `@Path` is relative to it and must
never repeat the segment; tests address the absolute path, which is what makes them catch a prefix
regression.

**Nothing on this surface is open, and the role says who a caller is meant to be.** Every endpoint
carries a `@RolesAllowed`, and there are exactly two roles:

| role | endpoints | how a caller holds it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `qits-platform:admin` | every read — applications, deployments, the environment listing/aggregate/links, the service listing — **and the operator's two levers**, `POST /applications/{id}/scale` and `/restart` | the forwarded `X-Qits-Roles` header only: the platform edge asserts it for an authenticated admin session, and the bootstrap asserts it on its own qits-net hop (`PdApi.ADMIN_HEADERS`) |
| `qits-platform:system` | the pins, every topology **write** (environment create/patch/delete, service upsert/delete) and the release intake | a machine bearer: qits-platform-idp copies `qits.idp.client.<id>.roles` into the token's `groups` claim, which quarkus-oidc reads as roles with no configuration at all |

The two sets do not overlap and must not. A machine token never carries `qits-platform:admin`, so
the read surface is a person's; a browser session never carries `qits-platform:system`, so the
machine surface is a machine's. **The read half is a change** — reads were open until the surface
was protected, on the reasoning both ancestors gave — and the collector that reads the pins is a
machine peer, so it presents its own token rather than nothing.

**Where `machineAuth.require()` goes** is the same question one layer in: on the paths whose callers
are machines — the intake and every topology write. It re-asks the audience question the token
already passed at `quarkus.oidc.token.audience`, so the annotation and the guard fail
independently; apply the same question to a new write and answer it in the commit that adds it.

The guard is **gated off** by `qits.auth.machine.required` (default `false`, shipped by
`qits-auth-core`). Validation follows the same gate
(`quarkus.oidc.tenant-enabled=${qits.auth.machine.required:false}`) — gate off, there is no OIDC
tenant, nothing fetches a JWKS, and a clone-alone build needs no issuer. There is no third state.
`@RolesAllowed` does **not** follow that gate: it is on in every posture, and what keeps a
credential-free `./mvnw test` green is `qits-auth-core`'s `%test` dev user, which is granted all
four platform roles.

**Three doors, and knowing which shut is how a grant is debugged.** A token for another service is
refused 401 by `quarkus.oidc.token.audience` before any identity exists; a token addressed here but
minted by a client with no `.roles` line authenticates and is refused **403** by `@RolesAllowed`; a
call with no credential at all is 401. `MachineGuardEnforcedTest` pins all three.

The intake path is a **cross-repo contract**: qits-ci POSTs
`/platform-deployments/api/events/software-released` fire-and-forget (and the bus is the ordinary
door). A mismatch raises no error
anywhere. Move one, move both.

**A new machine surface outside `/platform-deployments` needs a line in
`quarkus.quinoa.ignored-path-prefixes`, in the same commit.** Quinoa's SPA fallback is a catch-all
registered near-last, so a real route still wins — but a path matching *no* route is rerouted to
`index.html` and answers `200 text/html`, which a machine client parses as data. Setting the key
**replaces** Quinoa's derivation rather than extending it, and the values are matched **after**
`ui-root-path` is stripped — which is `/` here, so they are written **absolutely**. One entry,
`/platform-deployments`, covers `/api` and `/q` by prefix; a route outside that segment needs its
own. `@WebSocket` or anything on the Vert.x router takes a literal path and needs one too.

## The client, and where the segment still lives

`service/src/main/webui` is the **qits-deployments-platform-frontend** submodule. This service has a
host of its own, so the client is served at `/` and its `angular.json` sets `baseHref: /` — there is
no segment in the client at all. Its calls still go to `/platform-deployments/api`, which the edge
path-routes on every vhost.

The segment is spelled in four places that move together, all of them in this repository:
`quarkus.quinoa.ignored-path-prefixes`, `quarkus.rest.path`,
`quarkus.http.non-application-root-path`, and `routes:` in `.config/qits/deployments.yml`.
`PdPackagedSurfaceIT` probes the served base href, the scoped deep link, and `/platform-deployments/`
answering 404 rather than a second copy of the client.

## The event side: a RELEASE is the only trigger

**A green build deploys nothing any more.** `ReleaseAnnouncements` in `deployments/control` is the
seam for what comes IN, and what comes in is a released version: qits-ci minted a CalVer stamp,
pushed the tag, published `qits/<app>:<version>`, and announced it. `BuildAnnouncements`, `BuildTips`
and `bus/PdBuildSuccessfulSubscriber` are **deleted**, not dormant — two doors keyed on two
coordinates would deploy one application twice and race each other's cutover. (What goes OUT is
`DeployAnnouncer`, below.)

- **The bus** (`bus/PdSoftwareReleaseSubscriber`), a `QitsDurableEventListener` on qits-ci's
  `SoftwareRelease`. The publisher retries it, the log replays it after a cutover, and the library
  hands it over exactly once per event whichever channel delivered it.
- **`POST /platform-deployments/api/events/software-released`** (`api/PdEventController`). The
  **manual and bootstrap** door: a bootstrap replays a lost release, an operator redeploys a version
  or deliberately goes back one, and it is the only one that works before qits-events exists. Nobody
  retries it. `/events/build-succeeded` is **gone** and 404s.

Five things about the subscriber that are the whole of what a durable consumer owes:

- **Only `packageType: "docker"` is even looked at.** One release publishes a jar, an npm package, a
  docs bundle and an image as four events; only the image names something this component can put
  live, so `selects` answers false to the rest and they are stored nowhere at all.
- **The application name comes out of `packageName`, not out of a repository.** A `SoftwareRelease`
  carries `repoId`, `repository` (the same string) and an optional `projectId`, and **no repository
  name at all**. What it carries is the package, registry-unqualified — `qits/qits-ci` — and
  `PackageNames.applicationOf` takes the last segment. The repository travels beside it
  **id-addressed** (`RepositoryRef(repoId, projectId, null)`), for the spec read alone. `projectId`
  is identity enrichment and never a key: absent is tolerated and deploys identically.
- **`consumerId()` is `pd-software-released`, and it is storage.** Deliberately a NEW id rather than
  the retired `pd-build-succeeded` renamed — the old ledger is a watermark measured in
  `BuildSuccessful` rows and says nothing about this consumer's work — and **`replayFromEpoch()`
  returns `false` explicitly**, so the consumer initializes at the HEAD of the log. That override is
  a statement rather than a change: replaying from the epoch would, on the first boot after this
  ships, redeploy the platform's whole release history in log order. `PdBusReleaseIntakeTest` pins
  both.
- **Ordering is ours and is not optional.** Catch-up delivers late, so a *different, older* release
  can arrive after a newer one is live — a rollback nobody asked for. `ReleaseTips` collapses to the
  tip, per application, and takes two answers: what THIS PROCESS announced (a map, exact), and, only
  when that knows nothing, the **newest deployment REQUEST row** for that application (the
  cross-restart floor). The request rather than the deployment, because a request is written the
  moment a release is accepted — there is no minutes-later skew to reason about, and both sides of
  the comparison are version strings. **`Versions` compares them segment by segment, numerically**,
  and that is load-bearing: the stamp is unpadded, so `2026.731.193059` (19:30) sorts BEFORE
  `2026.731.93059` (09:30) as text and a lexical comparison would read the later release as the
  older one. Duplicates need nothing — the library already makes the same event id impossible twice.
- **A throw leaves the event owed forever.** It is offered again on every sweep and the watermark
  stays behind it, so one poison event stops this consumer's catch-up. So the handler **swallows
  what retrying cannot fix** — an unreadable payload, a package naming no application, an identifier
  `DeploymentIdentifiers` refuses — each with a WARN, and throws only what a next attempt could
  succeed at.

**Two facts about the transaction the handler runs in.** It is the library's claim transaction, on
the `eventstream` datasource — so every read of *this* component's database inside it takes a
`QuarkusTransaction.requiringNew()` of its own (two non-XA resources in one transaction is a thing
Narayana refuses), which is what `ReleaseTips` does. And `announce` returns as soon as the release
is queued, which it must: the handler is holding that transaction open while it runs.

### The deployment REQUEST, and the gate in front of the queue

`pd_deployment_request` (V6) is the row a release writes **before** anything is queued: application,
version, environment, the package and repository it came from, the quality gate and its detail, and
— once the gate is met — the `deployment_id` it handed off to. The environment is the tier the
release entered at, **including for a platform service**: the plane deploys into the designated tier
since V8, so the request names it exactly as the deployment does. (The column is still nullable, for
rows written before that.)

- **The request points at the deployment, never the reverse.** The request is the cause and is
  written first, so it cannot hold a key to a row that does not exist yet, and `pd_deployment` keeps
  the exact shape every existing reader of it has.
- **Both rows are written in ONE transaction, with the gate answered between them.** A request with
  a settled gate and no `deployment_id` therefore means *refused*, never "the process died in
  between".
- **`DeployService.gate` is a placeholder that says yes to everything**, and `PdQualityGate.UNMET`
  is unwritten today. That is the point of both existing now: the shape has to be in the schema and
  in the queueing transaction before a real gate has an opinion, or the first one arrives as a
  migration over live history. Whatever asks a question later answers in that one method — it takes
  the release AND the target, because a real gate is about a (version, place) pair.
- **It is a read surface too** (`PdDeploymentRequestController`, `qits-platform:admin`, every read
  wrapped in `PdReadPatience`), and it is a separate resource from the deployment listing rather
  than a richer answer to it, for the reason the table exists at all: **a refused request queues
  nothing**, so it has no deployment row to be seen through, and a client reading only the
  deployments would draw that release as never having happened.

  **Three filters, asked in ORDER, and the order is the API.** A request is one row three different
  screens reach by three different questions:

  | filter | answer |
  | --- | --- |
  | `?environmentId=` (`&applicationName=` optional) | one tier's, newest first — the front page's fold-by-name |
  | `?projectId=` | one project's: **every pending request plus the ten newest settled**, capped in `DeployService` |
  | `?repoId=&version=` | the exact-match join a release page follows — **both or neither**, half is a 400 |

  None of them is a 400 too. `GET /deployment-requests/{id}` sits beside the listing and **inlines
  the deployment**, because there is no deployment-by-id endpoint and minting one to serve a single
  screen would be a wider surface than the screen is.

  **An unknown PROJECT is an empty 200 where a missing TIER is a 404**, and the asymmetry is the
  honest one: a tier is this component's own row, a project is qits-projects' and this schema holds
  none — `project_id` sits beside `repo_id` as a foreign identity resolved by nobody. Say that in
  the javadoc of anything that adds a filter over a foreign identity.

  Note it takes **no `platform` value** where the deployment listing does — a request records no
  plane, and a platform service's request names the tier it deploys into, so it comes back in that
  tier's answer. `PdDeploymentRequestDto` deliberately derives no `applicationId`, because deriving
  `platform:` or `<tier>:` from a row with no plane column would be a guess; the frontend folds each
  request into its application's row by NAME.
- **Every request DTO carries `deploymentStatus`, joined from the row it points at**, on every path
  including the tier listing. The question a reader asks of a request spans two rows — the gate is
  on the request, the container is on the deployment — and neither answers it alone. Null is a real
  answer: a refusal queued nothing, and an environment teardown forgets deployment rows while the
  requests outlive them by design. **The join is one batch query per listing**
  (`PdDeploymentRepository.listByIds`), never a fetch per row, and `DeploymentMapper.toDto` takes
  the deployment as a nullable ARGUMENT so it cannot become one.
- **`control/RequestLifecycle` is the single spelling of pending-versus-completed**, and it states
  the rule as a POSITIVE list of the statuses that are still moving (`QUEUED`, `STARTING`,
  `SPEC_UNREADABLE`) plus an unanswered gate. `PdDeploymentStatus` is a varchar with no check
  constraint precisely so the vocabulary can grow, so a `!= ACTIVE`-shaped rule would read the next
  terminal word as in-flight. **The SPA mirrors it** (`isCompletedRequest` in the frontend's
  `api/dto.ts`) because the client draws the two sections and decides whether to keep polling; move
  one, move both.

### Where a release lands: the ENTRY TIER, not a branch

**Branch matching is gone from the intake path.** A release names a tag, not a branch, so the tier a
version enters is a property of the platform: `DeployService.entryTiers()` answers with the
**designated platform environment** (`pd_environment.platform`, of which there is exactly one), and
that is the whole of what replaced `tiersOnBranch`. Empty is a real answer — a mid-bootstrap install
registers nothing and deploys nothing rather than picking a tier at random, which is the answer
`registerPlatform` always gave. The link set written is still the **union** of what the catalogue
holds and the entry tier, so a tier a promotion already reached is never unlinked.

**`pd_environment.branch` is GONE** — the column (V8), `EnvironmentService.BRANCH_PREFIX`,
`onBranch`, `listByBranch`, the create/patch payload fields and the DTO field with it. An older
sender's `branch` still deserializes into nothing rather than failing a creation, which is the only
compatibility owed. `PdIdentifiers.requireBranch` stays: `pd_service.branch` (vestigial, written
null by derived registration, settable over the operator's `PUT`) and the parser's `deploy_branches`
tolerance are its callers. A promotion ladder is the follow-up this shape waits for: a version
promoted to the next tier is a deployment request of its own against another environment, which is
the row that now exists. **What must not come back is a branch.**

### …and the PLATFORM PLANE lands there too (2026-09-03)

**A platform service is deployed TO the designated environment, and "platform" stopped being
spelled as an absence.** It used to deploy with no tier at all: null `environmentId`/
`environmentName` on the four lifecycle events, no environment label, no `QITS_ENVIRONMENT`. That
read well — it serves every tier, so naming one would be untrue — and cost the plane the ability to
state anything about its own install: no tier in its telemetry, no tier on the events consumers
project a route table per environment from, and a resource registry keyed by a null. So the plane
deploys into `entryTiers()`' answer like everything else, and **both register arms now build a
`Target` from the same environment**.

**What the plane still decides is three things, and every one of them is asked of the SPEC's
`deployment_target: platform` rather than of a missing tier:**

- **the bare wire alias** (`PdNetworks.alias(target, env, app)` / `platformAlias`) — the address,
  and under swarm the service NAME. This is the one that would have been a silent outage: swarm
  cannot rename a service, so `dev-qits-ci` would be created beside the `qits-ci` that was serving.
  It is also what makes the existing fleet's platform services be updated in place by the first
  deployment under the new code;
- **the membership** — the `qits-platform` overlay on top of the flat one (`collapse`), which is the
  swarm spelling of "on every environment's networks";
- **the read-surface key** `platform:<name>` (`ApplicationKeys.of(target, …)`), which both sides of
  the client's join have to agree on — the catalogue side still carries no link, so a key taken from
  the tier would have broken the join one application at a time as each was redeployed.

**Everything that inferred the plane from an absent environment was converted, and the list is the
audit:**

| was | is |
| --- | --- |
| `pd_deployment.environment_id is null` = the plane | `pd_deployment.deployment_target`, a not-null column (V8) |
| `ApplicationKeys.of(environmentId, name)` | `of(target, environmentId, name)` |
| `PdNetworks.alias(null, app)` = bare | `alias(PLATFORM, env, app)` / `platformAlias(app)` |
| `ContainerNames.of(null, …)` = unqualified | `of(target, env, …)` |
| `listPlatformNewestFirst` = `environment_id is null` | `deployment_target = PLATFORM` |
| `listEnvironmentScoped` = `environment_id is not null` | `deployment_target = ENVIRONMENT` |
| `newestInPlaces(…, includePlatform)`'s `or environment_id is null` | deleted with the method — BuildTips' last caller went with the build trigger |
| `ResourceProvisioning`'s null lookup key | the tier's name, which for the plane is the designated one |
| `postgresHost(null)` → the designated tier's postgres | the tier arrives on the `Target`; null is a refusal |
| boot self-registration's null environment name | resolved from `pd_environment.platform` |
| swarm: no environment label for the plane | the label, plus a **`target=environment` filter on the teardown's reap** |
| swarm: no `QITS_ENVIRONMENT` for the plane | written for every service |

**The teardown filter is the one that had to move with the label.** `removeEnvironmentContainers`
reaps every service carrying a tier's environment label, and a platform service carries one now — so
it demands `qits.platform.deployments.target=environment` beside it, or tearing down the designated
tier would take the whole plane with it. (Deleting the designated tier is a 409 anyway; the two
guards are independent on purpose, because a designation moved a minute earlier would otherwise make
a teardown reap the plane.)

**V8 backfills, and it is the one backfill in this lineage.** A null `environment_id` meant the
platform plane and nothing else — V1's own header says so — so the translation is decidable: the
plane column is written from exactly that, and those rows are then moved onto the designated tier so
the successor's cutover finds them (two ACTIVE rows for one place is the invariant
`listActiveByApplication`, the pins and the observation pass are all written around). `pd_resource`
follows for the same reason one step further on: a lookup that missed would rotate a live password.
`PdSchemaTest` migrates to V7, writes the rows the old code wrote and migrates the rest of the way —
both the designated and the undesignated case.

### The application name is the repository's NAME, never its storage id (2026-08-21)

qits-githost is dumb blob storage now: its repository key is an opaque UUID and `/git/<uuid>` is an
internal URL only qits-projects speaks. The public identity is `(projectId, repoName)`, and both
doors carry it — the intake payload and the `BuildSuccessful` payload each gained a **nullable**
`projectId` and `repoName`.

**`applicationName = repoName != null ? repoName : repoId`, resolved ONCE in `announce` and threaded
by value from there.** That string is the image PATH `qits/<name>`, the wire alias, the
container name, the provisioned database and role, the `ApplicationKeys` key and the GC pin. Every
pipeline yml pushes its image as a literal `qits/<name>`, so an application named after a storage
UUID is every deployment ending `IMAGE_MISSING` **and** the orchestrator's collector deleting the
images that are live. `RepositoryRef` is the pair travelling together; below `announce` nothing takes
a repository id where a name is meant, and `deploy` is the one method holding both — the reference
for the spec read, the name for everything else.

**The fallback is compatibility, not a guess.** Before the rollback the storage id WAS the name, so
an announcement carrying neither field derives every identifier from the id, byte for byte what it
always did. `PdRegistrationTest` holds both arms.

**Where the id genuinely stays the id**: the spec source's address (below), and `BuildTips`' tip map,
which is keyed by `repoId` because the storage id is the repository's stable reference. Its
deployment-row **floor** follows the name — `pd_deployment` records an application name and knows no
repository id at all, so asking the rows by an id finds none and loses the cross-restart floor.

**No schema change was needed and none should be added.** `pd_deployment` and `pd_resource` have
always stored the application NAME and never a repository id (the no-FK, no-foreign-identity stance
in *Adding a dependency on another context*), so `applicationName`-as-name is the columns doing what
they already said.

### The spec is read at the RELEASED TAG, and the answer carries the commit (2026-09-03)

**`SpecSource.read` takes a git REV and returns a `SpecRead`, which is the spec plus the commit that
rev resolved to.** The ordinary caller passes `SpecSource.tagRev(version)` — `refs/tags/<version>`,
fully qualified — and the reason it is qualified is not tidiness: the git host resolves a bare
`2026.903.113443` perfectly well, and a *branch* of that name would win. The file that decides where
a container runs has to be the file the version was cut from.

**A rev is ONE path segment to the git host** (its route regex is `[^/]+` and its charset refuses a
literal `/`), so the slashes are percent-encoded: `/blob/refs%2Ftags%2F<version>/...`. jgit's
`Repository#resolve` then peels an annotated tag. A stub that reads `getRequestURI().getPath()`
instead of `getRawPath()` sees three segments and 404s everything — which is exactly what happened
to `stories/support/StoryPeers` and is why it reads the raw path now.

**The commit comes back in the `Git-Commit-Sha` header, and that is the only place a released
deployment can learn one.** qits-githost has no ref-resolution endpoint at all — no tag listing, no
ref→sha JSON — so without the header `pd_deployment.commit_sha` would be null forever and the edge
from a container back to a diff would be gone. One request, both answers. A response without the
header costs the trace edge and never the deployment.

**`GitHostSpecSource` reads one blob at two addresses.** With the name pair,
`GET <git-host-url>/git/<projectId>/<repoName>/blob/<sha>/.config/qits/deployments.yml`; without it,
the id-addressed URL it always used. Half a pair is no pair and takes the id route.
`GitHostSpecSourceTest` is plain JUnit over the JDK's own server — the two config values are
package-private fields, so no `@QuarkusTest` is involved — and it holds both arms, the 404 answer and
the 5xx refusal.

**`qits.platform.deployments.git-host-url` shipped a WRONG default for several releases**
(`http://qits-platform-artifacts:8080/artifacts`, the address the byte plane answered on before the
git host was split out of it). It is `http://qits-githost:8080` now, the sibling qits-ci's spelling.
Every deployment overrides the key, which is why it cost nothing and hid this long — and it is why
the shipped value carries no environment prefix: a prefixed hostname is deployment config.

### …unless the file says otherwise: `application:` (2026-08-30)

**`application:` in `.config/qits/deployments.yml` decouples the deployed identity from the
repository name, and it is the whole of the wrapper reorganisation's phase 2 for this component.**
Absent — which is every file that exists today — behaviour is byte-identical to the section above:
the application name is the repository's name. Present, that string IS the application name
everywhere the repository's would have been, and the list is the same one: the catalogue key, the
swarm service and its wire alias, the container name, the image `qits/<application>:<version>`, the
provisioned database and role, the derived `host` label, the extras family
`qits.platform.deployments.extras.<application>.*`, the `QITS_APPLICATION` the container boots with,
and the name every `Deployment*` event carries.

It exists so a repository can be **renamed** with nothing on the platform moving: `qits-ci` becomes
the repository `qits-ci-service`, writes `application: qits-ci`, and the running platform does not
notice. The image reference following the application rather than the repository is the feature — a
renamed repository's pipeline yml keeps pushing `qits/qits-ci`, and the deployer keeps pulling it.

Five things about it, each easy to undo by accident:

- **The substitution is `DeployService.deploy`'s, and there is exactly one of it.** The parser reads
  and validates the value and no more — it never knows which repository it is reading for, the
  `ResourceProvisioning.resolve` and `browserHost` arrangement applied to the value those two are
  themselves derived from. `announce` still settles the REPOSITORY's name (id vs the name pair);
  `deploy` settles the APPLICATION's, one line after the spec read, and everything below takes it by
  value exactly as before. A second substitution point is the regression to watch for.
- **The spec read still addresses the REPOSITORY.** `SpecSource.read` takes the `RepositoryRef`,
  which is unchanged and must stay so: the blob lives at `/git/<projectId>/<repoName>`, and an
  override that redirected the read would fetch somebody else's file.
- **An unreadable spec keeps the repository's own name**, so the `FAILED` rows go to the places
  registered under it — which for a repository that has been renamed AND overrides is no place at
  all. That is the honest answer rather than a gap: nothing knows which application a file it could
  not read was speaking for, and guessing would record a failure against a stranger.
- **Two repositories declaring one application name is LAST-WINS, and this component cannot refuse
  it.** `pd_service`, `pd_deployment` and `pd_resource` record an application NAME and no repository
  identity at all — V1's header states that as the rule — so there is nothing to compare a second
  claimant against. It is not a hazard the key introduces: two repositories in two projects may
  already carry one name and already collapse the same way. What the key adds is that every
  deployment taking an override logs which repository claimed which application, so the claim is on
  the record. **Refusing it is a follow-up with a price**: a repository identity on `pd_service` and
  a migration to hold it, which is a decision about foreign identity in this schema rather than a
  detail of this key — and it would have to key on the storage id, because the repository NAME is
  the thing phase 2 changes.
- **CHANGING the value later is a decommission and a new application, and nothing here helps.** The
  old name keeps its service, alias, database, rows and routes; the new one gets fresh ones and
  deploys beside it. The rename runbook moves repositories, never applications.

**The release door is unaffected**, and that was checked rather than assumed: qits-workspaces'
`DeploymentSpecReader` **stats** this file and never opens it (a file means "it deploys"), so a new
key is invisible to it. qits-ci's strict unknown-key parser only ever sees `ci-event-*.yml`. And,
like every spec key: **it must ship in the deployer before any repository writes the line**, since a
spec is read at the released tag and an unknown key fails a deployment.

### `navigation-entries` claims a (slot, label) pair, not a slot (2026-08-31)

**One application contributes SEVERAL rows to one heading, and the parser refused that outright for
a release.** `DeploymentSpecParser.navigationEntries` keyed its duplicate check on the slot alone,
so `navigation-entries: project.detail.Workspaces:1, project.detail.Editor:2=editor` — qits-workspaces
asking for the workspace list and the web editor under the project node, from one application in one
container — came back as "claims the slot `project.detail` twice" and the deployment failed with
`deployment spec unreadable` while its build stayed green. A list of placements exists precisely so
an application can appear in more than one place; the slot was never the thing being claimed.

The key is the **pair**. Three things about it:

- **The same `(slot, label)` twice is still an error**, and the message names the pair
  (``claims `project.detail.Editor` twice``) rather than the slot, so a file with four entries under
  one heading says which one is the duplicate. It is one row asked for twice and no shell can draw
  two of it.
- **A repeated POSITION is NOT an error, and that is a decision.** `NavigationEntry`'s own javadoc
  has always said a repeated number is an ordinary tie the consumer breaks by label, and both
  consumers do exactly that today — qits-edge sorts slot, position, label, application, and the
  shell's jslib re-sorts `position - position || label.localeCompare(label)`. Two applications at
  one number in one slot already render as two stably-ordered rows; refusing the same tie inside one
  application would be a rule the navigation document does not have, and the rows would render
  anyway if it did.
- **qits-edge widened the same rule in the same campaign** — `EdgeRoutes.validateSnapshot` and the
  projection's primary key, which was `(environment, application, slot)`. Move one, move both: the
  edge is a hop later, so a parser alone would have turned a refused spec into a refused frame.

### The cause rides the seam, because the scope cannot (2026-08-10)

**`announce` takes a fifth value now, `causationId`, and the domain modules hold the eventstream jar
for the causation persistence trio.** `CausedRow`, `CausationStamp` and `@Uncaused` are three
jakarta-persistence-shaped types with no publish, no subscribe and no wire in them, so the module
boundary narrows from "the bus lives in `service/`" to **"the bus's SEAMS live in `service/`"**: no
listener, no publisher, no `EventFrame`, no `QitsEventBus` and — deliberately — **no
`CausationScope`** in `environments/` or `deployments/`.

The scope is what forced the parameter. `CausationScope` is a plain ThreadLocal, and this whole
component runs a build-succeeded event on `pd-deploy-worker`: the door's scope stands on the calling
thread and is gone the instant the lambda runs elsewhere. Left to the `CausationStamp` listener,
every row this component writes would record null — measured in qits-ci on the same day, a full
trigger id beside an empty causation column. So each door reads the answer where it exists and
states it:

- `bus/PdSoftwareReleaseSubscriber` passes `frame.id()`, parsed leniently — an id that is not a UUID
  costs the trace edge and nothing else. **Causation must never be able to refuse a green build.**
- `api/PdEventController` passes `CausationScope.current()`, which `CausationServerFilter` restored
  from the caller's `X-Qits-Causation-Id`. Null is a hand-made bootstrap POST: a rootless deployment,
  which is a real answer rather than a gap.

`ServiceCatalog.upsert` has the same pair for the same reason — `upsert(Upsert)` for the REST door,
where the stamp works because nothing hops, and `upsert(Upsert, UUID)` that derived registration
calls from the worker. **A new writer on a background thread states its cause as data or it records
none**; `bus/PdCausationTest` drives `onFrame` from a scopeless thread precisely so a green
assertion can only mean the explicit set happened.

`ArchRulesTest` (qits-arch-rules, test scope) makes the decision mandatory: a new `@Entity` that
neither implements `CausedRow` nor declares `@Uncaused` fails the build naming the class. It lives
in `service/` because that is the only classpath carrying every entity of the component — both
domain jars and anything this module adds. The domain modules pay no test cost for the jar: neither
has a `@QuarkusTest`, so the eventstream persistence unit never boots there and only `service/`'s
`EmbeddedPgConfigSource` owes it a database.

### The other direction: what a deployment announces (2026-08-12)

**This component publishes now.** It consumed the bus for a release and produced nothing, so a
chain in the event log ended at `BuildSuccessful` — the container a commit ended up in was reachable
only by asking this component's API. Four events close it, one per lifecycle point, all in
`deployments-events/` and all published through `DeployAnnouncer` (`deployments/control`) by
`bus/DeployEventAnnouncer`:

| event | published from | timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DeploymentQueued` | `DeployService.queue`, one per created row | the row's `created_at` |
| `DeploymentStarted` | after the `QUEUED`→`STARTING` transaction | taken at the transition — there is no `started_at` column |
| `DeploymentActive` | after the cutover bookkeeping, last thing in `execute` — **and from the startup sweep's adoption**, which is the only path a self-update has | the row's `finished_at` |
| `DeploymentFailed` | the single `finish` funnel, when the status is not `ACTIVE` | the row's `finished_at` |

**All four carry the VERSION now, and `commitSha` beside it.** The version is the released
coordinate — what the image is tagged with, and what a consumer joins a deployment back to a release
by; the sha is the commit that tag resolved to, and it is a trace edge that may legitimately be
null. That is a **widening of the vocabulary jar**: a consumer reading the payload gains a field and
is otherwise untouched (the canonical mapper ignores unknown keys in both directions), but anything
CONSTRUCTING one of these records takes a new positional argument. Only this repository does.
`DeployEventsTest` holds the exact payload bytes, so a change here that is not also a change there
is a cross-repo break rather than a refactor.

Six things about it, each easy to undo by accident:

- **Every announcement happens AFTER the transaction that made it true**, so a consumer that reads
  the deployment back finds what the event said. `DeploymentActive` is deliberately the last
  statement in `execute`, after the old containers are reaped: an unreachable qits-events must delay
  nothing the deployment still has to do.
- **Announcing can never change a deployment's outcome.** `DeployService` wraps every call in a
  try/catch with a WARN, and the port says an implementation must not throw. Zero implementations is
  a supported configuration — `Instance<DeployAnnouncer>`, so a build without the bus deploys
  exactly as before.
- **The cause is data, and it does not need parsing here.** `PdDeployment.causationId` is a `uuid`
  column, set explicitly at queue time (see "The cause rides the seam"), and the announcer hands it
  to `publish(event, parent)`. qits-ci needs a defensive parse because its trigger id is a
  `varchar`; the leniency here already happened one layer up, in the subscriber.
- **`@ActivateRequestContext` is on every announcer method**, for the reason `ScmEventAnnouncer`
  carries it: `pd-deploy-worker` is a bare daemon thread with no request context, and the outbox
  needs one to open its transaction in. A `@QuarkusTest` driving the REST door has a context already
  and would not catch its absence — `PdDeployPublishTest` drives the worker.
- **`DeploymentObserver`'s later corrections announce nothing.** They restate an outcome minutes or
  hours later, and a consumer would first need to know that the second statement supersedes the
  first. That is a second design and it is not this one. So is `recordRejection`, which writes a
  `FAILED` row outside the `finish` funnel.
- **The startup sweep's ADOPTION does announce, and this entry is a reversal.** It used to be in the
  line above, and that was right while `DeploymentActive` was only a statement for a person to read.
  It stopped being right when the event grew `endpoints`: the platform edge projects its whole route
  table from that snapshot, so an adopted deployment that says nothing is an application the edge
  never learns a route for. **This component is that application, every single time** — its own
  self-update is `HANDED_OFF` to the orchestrator, `execute` returns before the cutover that
  announces, and the surviving instance's sweep is where it goes `ACTIVE`. It cost the deployer its
  own `/platform-deployments` route and its navigation entry on every platform: the old UI was
  reachable by nobody and missing from the menu, while every other application announced normally.
  An adoption is not a correction — it is the **first** statement anybody makes about a deployment
  that went live. `PdSweepAdoptionPublishTest` holds it.

  Two rules inside it. **The snapshot comes off the ROW and this announcement reaches no peer** —
  V3's routing columns, below — because it runs at BOOT, and the boot in question is the one right
  after a cutover. And **a snapshot that cannot be established announces NOTHING** — a tier that is
  gone, a row that recorded no routing — because a consumer replaces rather than merges, so an empty
  endpoint list would *delete* the routes it could not describe. A repository that genuinely declares
  none is a different thing and does announce its empty snapshot.

The vocabulary jar is `qits-platform-deployments-events`. It depends on `qits-eventstream` and
nothing else — see the partition above for why it is a module.


## Adding a dependency on another context

Don't. This component depends on three published qits jars — `qits-auth-core`, `qits-eventstream`
and `qits-arch-rules` (test scope) — and all three are **platform libraries rather than contexts**:
shared machinery, no domain, no entity of anyone else's. It has no dependency on another *context*
and should not grow one. Things arrive as an HTTP payload on the intake, as an event on the bus, as a URL in config, or
not at all. Never add a JPA relation to another context's entity.

**The bus does not change that, and the subscriber is written to keep it true.** qits-ci's
`SoftwareRelease` reaches this component as five strings decoded from a payload, against a signature
spelled as the literal `"SoftwareRelease"` — there is no dependency on `qits-ci-events` and there
must not be one. The cost is that a rename over there is silent here, which is the cost the intake
path already carries.

The rule reaches **inside this schema** too: `pd_deployment` names its service and its tier as plain
`String` columns with **no FK**, even though the topology is two tables away. Deployment history
outlives the rows that described it, and the rollback pins read off it must keep answering whatever
the catalogue says today.

## Schema changes

`environments/src/main/resources/db/platformdeployments/migration/`, hand-written, its own lineage on
its own datasource — keep appending, never edit an applied migration. It lives in `environments/`
because the component is one database; the module split is code, not storage.

**`V2__causation.sql` is that rule being followed, and it is also what "one lineage" looks like in
practice**: three `causation_id uuid` columns across two modules' tables in one file, because
`pd_deployment` belongs to `deployments/` and its `create table` is already here. Nullable, no
backfill, no index, and never a foreign key — the event it names lives in qits-events' store. The
per-entity decisions, each argued in the entity's own javadoc and enforced by `ArchRulesTest`:

| entity | decision | where the cause comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PdDeployment` | `CausedRow` | set explicitly in `DeployService.queue`/`recordRejection` — the whole feature, and the worker hop is why it is not stamped |
| `PdEnvironment` | `CausedRow` | the stamp, from the REST filter's restored scope; a tier is created on the request thread with no hop |
| `PdService` | `CausedRow` | explicit on the derived path, stamped on the operator's `PUT`. Created once and updated in place, which is what insert-only stamping is for |
| `PdServiceLink` | `@Uncaused` | none. Every upsert deletes and re-inserts the row, so the column would record the last rewrite rather than a cause |
| `PdResource` | `@Uncaused` | none. A converging registry entry rather than a record of an occurrence, and its other writer is boot self-registration with no event behind it |

**`V3__deployment_routing_snapshot.sql` is the one place a row holds a SPEC value**, and V1's header
says the spec's fields deliberately do not — so read its own header before adding a second. The rule
it bends was written for values whose only reader is the `execute` call that fetched them; routing
grew a reader that outlives the process, because a **self-update** is announced by the successor's
startup sweep, which has the row and no live process that read the file. Storing it is what keeps
that announcement off the network at boot. `upstream_port` is the **sentinel**: the spec always
resolves a port, so null means "queued before these columns" and never "no port", and `routes` being
null or empty is the ordinary answer of an application with no public routes.

**The store is PostgreSQL, and the lineage restarted at V1 to say so.** The H2 lineage (V1 + V2) was
deleted rather than continued, and that was a decision with one precondition: the migration onto
postgres is an **unwrap and a re-bootstrap**, so no database anywhere is on the H2 lineage and no
`V3__move_to_postgres.sql` had a reader. What the fresh V1 is, is the two H2 migrations translated —
identity columns instead of `auto_increment`, `text` instead of `clob`, V2's `platform` flag folded
into the table it belongs to with **no backfill**, since every database reaching it is empty and the
bootstrap creates the tier with the flag already set. Two parity notes are written into its header
because postgres would now permit what H2 could not, and the answers are still the code's: no check
constraint on any enum column, and no partial unique index on `pd_environment.platform`. **A second
clean start is not a precedent** — it cost a re-bootstrap, and the ordinary rule (append, never edit)
is back from V1 onward.

**`V6__deployment_request.sql` adds the decision in front of the queue** — see *The event side* for
what a request is and why it is not a column on `pd_deployment`. It points AT the deployment
(`deployment_id`, nullable) rather than the other way round, because the request is the cause and is
written first.

**`V7__deployment_version.sql` is the coordinate change, and its whole care is the two nulls.** A
deployment is a released version now, so `pd_deployment.version` holds the CalVer stamp — the tag
the image carries, the rev the spec is read at, and what the startup sweep compares a running image
against. `commit_sha` survives, is **nullable**, and means what it says: the commit the released tag
RESOLVED to, read out of the git host's `Git-Commit-Sha` header. Null there is a real answer (a
repository with no `deployments.yml` 404s the blob read, which says nothing about where the tag
points).

**There is NO backfill and there must not be one.** A row written before V7 describes a deployment
whose image really is tagged with a sha, so copying that sha into `version` would make the rollback
pins claim a tag that does not exist. Every reader goes through **`PdDeployment.imageTag()`** — the
single spelling of "what tag is this deployment's image", version first and commit_sha behind it —
and three of them have to agree: the pull, the sweep's adoption check, and `RollbackPins`. Adding a
fourth reader that touches `version` directly is the regression.

**The pin wire field is still called `shas` and must stay so.** qits-artifacts' image collector
parses `{"pins":[{"applicationName","shas"}]}` and matches each string against an OCI tag by plain
equality, so it followed the version change with no edit at all — and it is **fail-closed**, so a
renamed field would abort garbage collection across the platform rather than degrade it. The values
inside changed; the contract did not.

**`V8__platform_plane_is_the_main_environment.sql` gives `pd_deployment` the PLANE as a column,
backfills it, moves the plane's rows onto the designated tier, and drops `pd_environment.branch`** —
see *…and the PLATFORM PLANE lands there too* for what changed above the file and why the backfill
is the decidable kind. Three things worth carrying:

- **`deployment_target` is not null and has no default**, `pd_service.deployment_target`'s rule
  applied to the execution row: every writer states the plane, and a row that could not say would be
  the inference the file exists to remove. A test fixture that builds a `PdDeployment` by hand sets
  it (`PdSchemaTest`, `PdSweepAdoptionTest`, `PdDeploymentObservationTest`, `PdDeploymentOrderingTest`,
  `PdSweepAdoptionPublishTest` all do).
- **The backfill reads exactly one statement**: `environment_id is null` meant the platform plane,
  by V1's header, so it becomes `PLATFORM` plus the designated tier. On an install with no
  designation the subselect answers null and nothing moves — which is every database the suite
  migrates.
- **`pd_resource` moves with it**, and the stale per-tier row it would collide with is deleted
  first. The registry key is what `ResourceProvisioning` looks a credential up by before every
  deploy; a miss takes the reconcile arm and rotates a password a running container is using.

The suites run every migration against an **empty** schema, so a backfill is untested by them.
`deployments/src/test/.../PdSchemaTest` is the shape to copy: plain JUnit, a real postgres from
`EmbeddedPg`, Flyway, then the claims. A migration that backfills needs a test that migrates to the
version before, writes the rows the old code wrote, and migrates the rest of the way —
`Flyway.configure().target("<version>")` is how it stops halfway. (V2's backfill test was that, and
it went with V2.)

Write inserts in those tests with **named columns**. A positional one makes every later migration a
change to a test that had nothing to do with it — the H2 lineage's V2 demonstrated it by adding one
column and breaking every positional insert in the suite.

Deployment listings order by `seq`, V1's identity column, and **not** by `createdAt desc, id desc`:
the id is a random UUID, so that tiebreak swapped two rows recorded in the same tick at random —
which is what the deployments of one build-succeeded event are, and what a client reads "the current
one per application" off.

**Nulls are distinct to `=`, and the queries still test for one.** A platform deployment's
`environment_id` was null until V8 and is the designated tier now, so the null-testing arms of
`listActiveByApplication`/`listByApplication` are there for rows written before it on an install
that had designated nothing. Keep them: `= ?` matches nothing against a null, and the startup
sweep's adoption hangs on it — get it wrong and a self-updating instance comes back having failed
its own deployment while a second row still claims to be ACTIVE. **What must not come back is a
query that reads the null as a PLANE**; that question is `deployment_target` now.

## Dependencies

**The client is the only submodule.** `service/src/main/webui` is
qits-deployments-platform-frontend; `git submodule update --init` is half of a clone here, and
`.config/qits/ci-post-receive.yml` runs it for that reason. Shared auth comes from the platform
Maven repository as `qits-auth-core`, and the event bus client as `qits-eventstream` — ordinary
Maven dependencies, never gitlinks.

**Both are version-pinned by a property in the root pom, one line each**, because a release train
step rewrites exactly that element: `.config/qits/ci-event-upstream-auth-core.yml` and
`.config/qits/ci-event-upstream-eventstream.yml` each `sed` one `<…version>` and force-push the
result onto a maintenance branch. A second spelling of either version anywhere would be left
behind. A bump lands on a branch and not on main on purpose: a library release is not a decision to
redeploy the deployer.

**`qits-eventstream` sits in all four modules now**, and only `service/` uses it for the bus: the
domain modules take it for the causation persistence trio and `deployments-events` for `QitsEvent`
itself, which is a narrowing of the boundary rather than a hole in it — see "The cause rides the
seam". `deployments/` additionally holds `qits-platform-deployments-events`, because
`DeployAnnouncer` is spelled in those records; they are plain data with no publish and no transport
in them, so that is the same narrowing rather than the bus reaching into a domain module. `qits-arch-rules` is a third published
jar, test scope, in `service/` only; it is version-pinned by a property of its own and no release
train step rewrites it.

**`qits-eventstream` brings two extensions new to this deployable** — `quarkus-scheduler` (the
outbox and catch-up sweeps) and `quarkus-websockets-next` (the stream client, which registers no
route, so `quarkus.quinoa.ignored-path-prefixes` is unchanged) — and one **mandatory deployment
resource**, below.

**`quarkus-oidc-client` is back and it is one peer's**, `service/` only: the bearer
`confighost/IdpExtrasBearer` presents to qits-configuration. It is the other direction from
`quarkus-oidc`, which validates what arrives. It ships disabled in both spellings — the named client
and the default one — so a clone-alone build needs no idp, reaches no network and holds no secret;
see the extras section above for the switch and the deployment-side family.

**`quarkus-undertow` must never be on the classpath.** Its presence breaks Quinoa's production static
serving — the client 404s from a build that was green — and it arrives *transitively* from anything
servlet-shaped:

    ./mvnw -pl service -am dependency:tree | grep -i undertow

**Quinoa is in no BOM**, so its version is pinned by hand in the root pom's properties. 2.8.2 is the
last release built against a Quarkus *older* than the platform's 3.34.6; 2.8.3 is built against
3.36.2, ahead of us. Bump only when the platform's Quarkus passes the version a release is built
against.

## Tests

- App-level config lives in `service/src/main/resources/application.properties` and Quarkus merges it
  into the test config. **Never re-declare an app-level setting in test resources** — the test copy
  carries only the port, the persistence-unit wiring and `quarkus.devservices.enabled=false`.
- **No dev services and no containers, ever.** A dev service is a container start, and the first rule
  here is that a clone tests green with no docker. `quarkus-oidc` in particular launches a real
  Keycloak the moment a profile leaves `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` unset — measured on the
  ancestors, not feared. The store being postgres does not change that answer: `testdb/EmbeddedPg`
  starts **zonky's** postgres — real binaries resolved as Maven artifacts, spawned as a child
  process — and `testdb/EmbeddedPgConfigSource` hands its url, username and password to every
  `@QuarkusTest` at an ordinal above `application.properties`, because the port is chosen at run
  time and cannot be written down. Testcontainers is not on this classpath and must not arrive.
  `EmbeddedPg` is **copied** into `deployments/` rather than shared: a test-jar dependency between
  two modules that have none is the higher price.
- **That config source hands out SIX values, not three, and the second three are easy to think
  unnecessary.** The bus is dark in `%test`, and **dark is not absent**: `qits.eventstream.enabled=false`
  stops dialling, sweeping and claiming, not the datasource — Quarkus opens the connection and runs
  Flyway at boot regardless. So the `eventstream` store gets a database of its own on the same
  embedded instance, or the suite does not start. Only `clean-at-start` is written in the test
  properties file; the locations and the persistence-unit wiring ship in the jar and a copy here
  would drift.
- **The bus darkness itself is asserted**, in `bus/PdEventstreamDarknessTest`, for the reason the
  OTel keys are: the way a missing switch fails is not a failure but a suite that redials an
  unresolvable host every thirty seconds and reads as slow. It also asserts the subscriber survives
  ArC's unused-bean removal — nothing injects it by name, and a removed listener consumes nothing
  and says nothing to admit it.
- **The bus tests drive `onFrame` directly, not a stub qits-events.** What belongs here is this
  component's half — the decode, the tip check, the call into the seam. The funnel, the claim ledger
  and the catch-up sweep are the library's and are proved in its own repository; a stub here would
  re-prove them and prove nothing about a deployment.
- **The PUBLISHING test aims the bus at a closed port**, which is the same stance from the other
  side: `PdDeployPublishTest` turns the bus on in its own `@TestProfile` (`qits.events.url` is
  `http://localhost:1`, the scheduler and the startup catch-up are off), so every publish lands as
  exactly one `outbox_event` row with the canonical payload it would have been sent with. A row IS
  the publish from this side of the bus. It reads them through the `eventstream` persistence unit's
  own `EntityManager`, never a Panache static — `OutboxEvent` comes from a jar this application did
  not compile, and the static throws naming the wrong problem.
- **Machine-token tests mint their own tokens.** `MachineTokens` signs RS256 with the key pair in
  `service/src/test/resources/machine-token-*.pem`, and `MachineGuardEnforcedProfile` hands
  quarkus-oidc the public half, so the enforced path is exercised end to end with no
  qits-platform-idp to reach. Those PEMs are **test fixtures, not credentials**.
  **A minted token carries `groups`**, because the idp's does and because `@RolesAllowed` reads
  nothing else — a fixture that mints only `iss`/`sub`/`aud` produces a caller that authenticates
  and is then refused 403 on every guarded call. `MachineTokens.rolelessToken` mints exactly that,
  on purpose, to assert the refusal.
- `FakeDeploymentDriver` and `FakeSpecSource` are `@Mock` and application-scoped, so they are shared
  across tests: reset both in `@BeforeEach`, use distinct **environment names, repository ids and
  service names** per test, and read their state through their **methods** — the injected reference
  is a CDI client proxy, and a field read on a proxy sees the proxy's fields, not the bean's. The
  suite shares one embedded database across classes (Flyway cleans at start, not between tests), and
  a **platform** service registered by one class shows up in every other class's link query — so
  assert with `hasItem`, never with a size.
- They live in `…deployments.control`, the seam's own package, which is also what lets
  `PdSweepAdoptionTest` drive the package-private `sweepInFlight()`.
- Flow tests poll the read surface to a deadline rather than reaching into the service — the same way
  a caller experiences the API, and immune to the worker's timing. Platform deployments used to be
  the one thing that surface could not show; they name the designated tier now, so
  `/deployments?environmentId=<tier>` carries them and `?environmentId=platform` asks the same rows
  by plane. `awaitApplied` (wait on the driver) survives because it is still the shortest way to
  synchronise on a deployment the worker has finished, not because the listing is blind.
- `OpenApiSchemaExportTest` writes `docs/openapi.yml`. Regenerate and commit when the surface
  changes: `./mvnw -pl service -am test -Dtest=OpenApiSchemaExportTest
  -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false`. The intake is `@Operation(hidden = true)` (a wire API);
  everything else is the document. The test classpath is indexed too, so a new `@Path` resource under
  `src/test` lands in the committed document unless it is hidden.
- `PdPackagedSurfaceIT` runs the **packaged artifact** (fast-jar under `-DskipITs=false`, binary
  under `-Dnative`) and asserts what a native build can silently lose: the build-time route prefixes,
  the shipped datasource *expressions* — **both** of them now, since it hands the launched process
  `QITS_RESOURCE_DB_*` and `QITS_RESOURCE_EVENTSTREAM_*`, the generic contract a deployment
  supplies, rather than restating the datasource keys, so the jars' own `${…}` indirection is what
  is under test and a packaged artifact missing either triple fails here rather than in a
  deployment — Flyway's migration surviving as
  a resource, and — the claim the ancestors could not make —
  both domains round-tripping in one process against one database. Its embedded postgres reaches
  the profile through a **system property**, because a `QuarkusTestProfile` is instantiated in two
  classloaders and a static field is not shared between them. It points
  `qits.platform.deployments.container-runtime` at a binary that does not exist, which keeps it
  free of host side effects and proves every driver call degrades to a warning rather than a
  failure.
- **`PdPackagedSurfaceIT` is also the only test that ever sees the client.** Quinoa is disabled in
  test mode, so no `@QuarkusTest` here has a client at all — a unit test asserting anything about the
  segment would pass against a process serving nothing.
- **`TokenValidationBootstrapIT` is the second packaged IT and the first class of the userflow
  catalogue.** It opens the gate — `qits.auth.machine.required=true`, which is what turns the shipped
  `quarkus.oidc.tenant-enabled=${qits.auth.machine.required:false}` on — and points
  `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` at `MockIdp`. That is the half of the shipped OIDC block no other
  test reaches: `MachineGuardEnforcedTest` opens the same gate but **inlines the verification key and
  clears `auth-server-url`**, precisely so it needs no idp — so the boot-time JWKS fetch,
  `discovery-enabled=false` with `jwks-path=jwks` joined onto the URL, and `connection-delay` are
  exercised here or nowhere. Both its stories drive `GET /platform-deployments/api/pins`, the one
  guarded read whose caller is a machine (`qits-platform:system`, qits-platform-artifacts' image
  collector) and which reads nothing but deployment rows.

### The userflow catalogue

Twelve `@UserStory` methods in five classes, so `mvn verify -DskipITs=false` also emits
`service/target/userstories/` — a story log plus a mermaid **network** diagram each — which
`.config/qits/ci-event-userflows.yml` publishes per commit as the docs bundle
`@userflows/qits-deployments`. They are **browserless** (an `Interactions` parameter and no `Flow`),
so qits-userflows-javalib's transitive Playwright never launches anything.

| class | category | what it is about |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `api.TokenValidationBootstrapIT` | `authentication` | the boot-time JWKS fetch and the three doors of the pin ledger |
| `stories.configuration.DeploymentConfigurationIT` | `configuration` | the extras read with the deployer's own credential, and the refusal when it cannot be read |
| `stories.deployment.BuildDeploymentIT` | `deployments` | a green build end to end — create, replace in place, and an image nobody published |
| `stories.operations.PlatformOverviewIT` | `operations` | what an operator reads, and the keep-set qits-platform-artifacts reads |
| `stories.refusals.AccessRefusalIT` | `refusals` | the two role sets, and the fact that they do not overlap |

Six things about how they are built, each easy to undo by accident:

- **ONE `@TestProfile` for all five** — `stories.support.StoryProfile`, which extends
  `PdPackagedSurfaceIT.PackagedUnderTarget` (one answer to "what does a launched
  qits-platform-deployments need in order to boot", one parking trick, `databaseUrl` reused rather
  than copied) and adds its own two databases plus every seam a story moves. A `@TestProfile` is what
  failsafe launches a process for, so a second profile would be a second deployer with a second
  startup whose traffic landed in whichever diagram happened to be open. **A new story class names
  this profile or it is a new process.**
- **The diagram is observed, not narrated.** `Interactions` records notes only. The near side is
  `NetworkTaps.restAssured` — the framework SHIPS the filter this repo kept a hand-written copy of
  until 2026.829, and the copy (`api/StoryNetworkFilter`) is deleted. The far sides are cumulative
  `NetworkCapture.source`s: `MockIdp`'s recording, `stories.support.StoryPeers`' access log and
  `stories.support.StorySwarm`'s call log. `NetworkCapture.actor(...)` before a call is what names an
  edge's initiator, because a bearer cannot say whether the caller is qits-ci or an impostor.
- **The orchestrator hop is EVIDENCE, not a claim.** `PdProcess` spawns the docker CLI, so
  `StorySwarm` writes a recording POSIX-sh executable and the profile points
  `qits.platform.deployments.container-runtime` at it. It keeps enough state — services, their
  environment, and *when an update was issued*, stamped in Go's own `time.Time.String()` spelling —
  that `awaitConverged`'s `StartedAt` matching runs for real against it. Labels are **summaries**
  (`service create story-tier-story-web -> 0`), never argvs: a `service create` carries a generated
  deployment uuid and a Go `--format` full of braces, and either would move the `networkHash` or
  break the mermaid. A story that wants a FLAG asserts on `StorySwarm.argvOf(...)` instead.
- **`StoryPeers` is one stub impersonating three peers, attributed by path** — `/git/…` is
  qits-githost, `/configuration/…` is qits-configuration, `/idp/token` is qits-platform-idp. It is
  stateless: every answer is a pure function of the application name in the path, which is why
  `story-misconfigured` is refused in every run and in every order.
- **Order is load-bearing, and it is the class orderer's.** A cumulative source is attributed by a
  cursor, so pre-story traffic lands in whichever story drains first — the JWKS fetch belongs to
  `TokenValidationBootstrapIT`, and `PlatformOverviewIT` reads rows `BuildDeploymentIT` deployed.
  `@UserflowRunsAfter` states it; ties break by FQCN, which is why the packages are named so that
  alphabetical is the intended order (`…deployments.api` before
  `…deployments.stories.{configuration,deployment,operations,refusals}`). The orderer is registered as
  `junit.quarkus.orderer.secondary-orderer` in `service/src/test/resources/application.properties`:
  quarkus-junit ships its own `junit-platform.properties` and surefire hard-fails on a local one that
  overrides it.
- **Fixtures are invisible to the tap by construction.** `stories.support.StoryPlatform` creates the
  tier and polls for a settled deployment through a plain `HttpClient` — a client no RestAssured
  filter is attached to — so a diagram shows the walk somebody takes and not the fixture somebody
  built. It is called from `@BeforeEach`, because `RestAssured.port` is `-1` in `@BeforeAll`.

**Two coverage gaps, stated rather than hidden:**

- **The observation ticker is OFF in the story profile** (`observe-interval-seconds=0`).
  `DeploymentObserver` asks the orchestrator `service ps <name>` — **byte-identical** to the call a
  deployment's own convergence check makes — so a recording cannot tell a timer pass from a
  story-driven one, and an arrow that appears depending on how long a story took is a `networkHash`
  that never settles. Filtering only works when lines differ by content. So no story covers the
  observer's `FAILED`/`GONE` → `ACTIVE` recovery, its two-strike demotion or its decommissioning of a
  recovered row's predecessor; `PdDeploymentObservationTest` holds those against the fake driver and
  they stay a `@QuarkusTest`'s claim.
- **No story provisions a resource.** `ResourceProvisioning` speaks DDL to a postgres reached at
  `PdNetworks.alias(<tier>, "qits-oci-postgresql")` — derived, never configured — so a story would
  need a host by that name. The story specs declare no `resources:`, and the provisioning matrix
  stays `PgResourceProvisionerTest`'s (which runs against a real postgres for its own good reasons).
  The same goes for the self-update's `HANDED_OFF` arm and the startup sweep's adoption: both need a
  process that is replaced mid-deployment, which a story cannot stage.

- **`skipITs` stays `true` in the root pom and the userflow pipeline opts in by name**
  (`-DskipITs=false "-Dit.test=TokenValidationBootstrapIT,DeploymentConfigurationIT,BuildDeploymentIT,PlatformOverviewIT,AccessRefusalIT"`).
  That run passes `-Dquarkus.quinoa=false` — the step container's clone does not recurse, so
  `service/src/main/webui` arrives empty — and half of `PdPackagedSurfaceIT` is about the client, so
  a blanket opt-in would make it red on a test that is right. **A new story class joins that comma
  list in the commit that adds it**, or it never runs in CI.
- **Both poms that name zonky architectures carry the `-alpine` binaries as a fourth arch**
  (`deployments/`, `service/`). The CI step containers are Alpine (musl) and `verify` there is the
  whole reactor; a missing arch resolves fine and then fails mid-suite with no binary for the
  platform it is on.

## The image and the pipeline

`docker/Dockerfile` and `.config/qits/ci-post-receive.yml` are two halves of one thing, and the seam
between them is the only reason either is interesting: **the client cannot be built inside a docker
build.** It depends on `@qits/ui-components`, which lives only on the platform's own npm registry,
and a `RUN` step reaches the public internet but reaches that registry by no address at all. So the
pipeline step installs and builds the bundle, and the Dockerfile's builder stage neuters Quinoa's
install/ci/build commands to `--version` and packages what it was handed.

Four things follow, each load-bearing:

- **`.dockerignore` does NOT exclude the client's `dist/`.** That departs from the platform's Quinoa
  reference — here `dist/` is the payload, and excluding it fails the build at the `test -f` guard.
- **The two `package-manager-install` flags exist only on the Dockerfile's `mvnw` line**, because the
  Mandrel builder image ships no node. They must never go into `application.properties`: a local or
  CI build must use the node on `PATH`, so no build silently downloads a toolchain. `22.22.0` is the
  platform pin.
- **The bundle is `cp`'d onto itself before the build.** Quinoa *moves* `build-dir` rather than
  copying it, and overlayfs cannot rename a directory that still lives in a lower image layer — it
  answers EXDEV and the JDK's fallback refuses a non-empty directory, dying with
  `DirectoryNotEmptyException` seconds in. The `cp` re-materialises it in the layer that is about to
  move it, which is why it has to be in that same `RUN`.
- **`docker build --network host`, never a custom network.** Buildkit is the builder format the
  platform targets and it refuses custom networks on a build; the ancestor's `--network qits-net`
  only worked because an older CLI in the step image fell back to the legacy builder. The maven
  registry URL is derived from `$QITS_REGISTRY` so no address is stated in the file.

The pipeline also rewrites `package-lock.json`'s `resolved` **origins** before `npm ci`: npm fetches
tarballs by the absolute URL in the lockfile and ignores the configured registry, and npm's own
`--replace-registry-host` is broken for a registry mounted under a path prefix. The committed
lockfile keeps the developer-host origin, which is correct locally.

**This repo is its own deployer**, and it is a **platform service** again — one instance for the
whole platform, deploying every environment. Its `.config/qits/deployments.yml` spells
`deployment_target: platform` out and names no branch at all: a push to the branch the *platform*
environment listens to is a deployment. A green run announces this component to itself, and **under
swarm** it deploys itself: the manager arbitrates the succession, the `/platform-deployments`
surface blips mid-cutover (this repo's spec says `update_order: stop-first`), and a successor that
misses its health gate leaves the predecessor serving.

**The flip itself is the exception, and it takes a hand step** — a service name is its address under
swarm and swarm cannot rename one, so the deploy that moves this component from
`<env>-qits-deployments` to bare `qits-deployments` creates the successor beside the predecessor and
removes nothing. `docker service rm <env>-qits-deployments` once the new one is healthy. README's
*The plane flip is one deploy, and it needs one hand step* has the whole sequence, including the
one-time password rotation that comes with it.

**There is no deploy ref any more, on either plane.** A RELEASE deploys — see *The event side* —
and it lands in the platform's entry tier. `platform/main`, `SpecSource.DEFAULT_PLATFORM_BRANCH`,
the spec's `branch:` key and, now, `environment/<name>` as a trigger are all gone. `main` stays the
integration trunk, and a push to it still builds and ships nothing; so does a push to anything else.

**Which environment is the entry one is the same column it always was** — `pd_environment.platform`,
true on exactly one row. What it decides has widened rather than moved: it used to say which
tier's branch may roll the platform plane, and it now says which tier a release ENTERS at, on both
planes. `DeployService.entryTiers()` is the one reader.

The flag is a designation, not a link. A platform service still belongs to no tier, still keeps the
bare wire alias, and is still reachable from every environment. **`EnvironmentService.designate`
moves it** — clearing the old holder and setting the new one in one transaction — because that is
where the invariant belongs. Postgres does have a partial unique index and V1 deliberately declines
it: an index would also forbid the intermediate state of the very two statements that move the flag.
Clearing the flag outright is a 409, and so is deleting the environment holding it; both would leave
the platform with nowhere for a release to land. `PdEnvironmentApiTest` holds those claims, and
`PdDeploymentFlowTest.thePlatformPlaneIsRolledOnceByTheTierTheReleaseEntersAt` holds the gate.

**`deploy_branches:` is retired: accepted, validated, acted on by nobody.** Its one reader was
qits-workspaces' release flow, which pushed a release onto *every* branch the list named — a
fan-out rather than a ladder, and with three tiers it would have shipped into all three at once. A
release lands on one entry branch from that component's own configuration now, and no repository
states it. The parser still tolerates the key, and the reason is sharper than the `singleton`
alias's: **a spec is fetched at the RELEASED tag**, so a redeploy of an older version still presents
a file carrying it, and an unknown key fails a deployment. Do not write it into a new file; do not
remove the tolerance.
