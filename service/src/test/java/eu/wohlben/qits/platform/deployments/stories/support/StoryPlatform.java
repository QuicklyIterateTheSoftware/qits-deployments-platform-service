/**
 * The platform a story <b>walks up to</b> rather than builds — one tier, listening to one branch —
 * and the patience a story spends waiting for the deploy worker.
 *
 * <h2>Setup is invisible to the tap, by construction</h2>
 *
 * <p>A story's diagram must show the walk somebody takes, not the fixture somebody built. The tap
 * that would see this class is the framework's RestAssured filter, which is JVM-global once
 * installed — so everything here drives the API with a plain {@link HttpClient} instead, a client no
 * filter is attached to, and not one fixture request becomes an arrow into the deployer.
 *
 * <p>The tier is created with a MACHINE bearer and read back with the PERSON's header pair, because
 * that is what each door takes: a topology write is {@code qits-platform:system}'s and the
 * deployment listing is {@code qits-platform:admin}'s. A fixture that presented one credential
 * everywhere would be a fixture that could not exist against the running service.
 *
 * <h2>Provisioned once, for whichever story class runs first</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every story class that needs it calls {@link #provision()}; the first one does the work and the
 * rest find it done. That is what makes each class runnable on its own ({@code
 * -Dit.test=AccessRefusalIT}) while a full run creates exactly one tier. It has to be called from
 * {@code @BeforeEach} rather than {@code @BeforeAll}: it builds a url out of {@code
 * RestAssured.port}, which the Quarkus integration-test extension sets in beforeEach and clears back
 * to {@code -1} in afterEach.
 *
 * <h2>Waiting is a poll of the read surface, never a sleep</h2>
 *
 * <p>A software-release event is handled whole on {@code pd-deploy-worker} — spec read, registration,
 * queueing, the orchestrator, the cutover — and the intake returns 202 the moment it is queued. So
 * "the deployment finished" is only observable through the rows, which is also how a caller
 * experiences this service. {@link #awaitSettled} polls until the row for one (application, commit)
 * leaves {@code QUEUED}/{@code STARTING}, which is exactly when every edge that deployment produces
 * is on disk.
