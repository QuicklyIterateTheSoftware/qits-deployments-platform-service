/**
 * The operator's two levers, end to end: the door, the worker, the orchestrator call and the row.
 *
 * <p>Package-local for the reason {@link PdDeploymentObservationTest} is — the recovery half of a
 * scale is an observation pass, and driving one directly is the only way to assert it without a
 * ticker. Rows are written straight to the table for the same reason too: what these levers act on
 * is an application that is already deployed, and staging a real green build to reach that state
 * would be asserting the deployment path a second time.
 *
 * <p><b>Every call is answered 202 and the work happens on the deploy worker</b>, so each assertion
 * waits on {@link DeployService#awaitIdle()} rather than on the response — which is exactly what a
 * caller of this API is told to do, and what makes these tests immune to the worker's timing.
