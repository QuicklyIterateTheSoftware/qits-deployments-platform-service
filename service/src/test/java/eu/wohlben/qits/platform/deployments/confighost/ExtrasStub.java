/**
 * A qits-configuration that answers whatever a test scripts, on a real socket.
 *
 * <p><b>It is an HTTP stub rather than a fake at the seam</b>, and that is deliberate for these
 * tests alone: what is under test here IS the request — the url it is built at, the headers it
 * carries and the patience it spends — and a fake {@code DeploymentExtrasSource} would assert the
 * test's own model of a client. Everything ABOVE the seam uses a scripted lambda instead, which is
 * the repo's ordinary fake doctrine.
 *
 * <p><b>It answers BOTH directions</b>, because qits-configuration is one peer: the resolved read a
 * deployment makes, and the declaration a release seeds. The answer is scripted the same way for
 * both — this stub has no idea which is which, and does not need one. What tells them apart in an
 * assertion is the method and the address, which is exactly what tells them apart on a platform.
 *
 * <p>The JDK's own server, so nothing arrives on the classpath and no docker is involved.
