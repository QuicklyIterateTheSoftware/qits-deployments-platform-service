/**
 * <b>A green build, end to end</b> — the walk this component exists for, from the event qits-ci
 * sends to a service the orchestrator is running and a row an operator can read.
 *
 * <p>The three stories are the three shapes a build takes, and each is a different diagram:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the application is <b>new to the tier</b>: the spec is read at the built sha, the
 *       configuration is read for the argv, and the orchestrator is asked to CREATE a service whose
 *       name is the wire alias peers will dial;
 *   <li>the application is <b>already there</b>: the same walk ends in a {@code service update} of
 *       that same service — a swarm service's name IS its address, so a replace is an update in
 *       place and not a second service beside the first. One extra question is asked on the way
 *       ({@code service env}), and it is the whole of what "config is the source" costs;
 *   <li>the registry <b>published nothing</b>: one {@code docker pull}, a row that says so, and
 *       <b>nothing else at all</b> — no configuration read, no service, no network touched. That is
 *       the strongest claim in this catalogue, because a deployment that had already created
 *       something before it found out would have to undo it.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The orchestrator edges are observed, not declared.</b> {@code deployments/control/PdProcess}
 * spawns the docker CLI and reads its pipes, so {@code stories.support.StorySwarm} stands in for the
 * binary and records every argv with the exit code it answered. The one edge that <b>is</b> declared
 * is this component's own postgres: no tap on this side can see a JDBC round trip, and the ordering
 * it guarantees — the row is written before anything is attempted, which is what makes a failed
 * deployment diagnosable — is the invariant everything else here rests on.
 *
 * <p><b>The stories are ordered and the order is load-bearing</b>: the second is about the service
 * the first created, and running it alone would be a story about a create claiming to be an update.
