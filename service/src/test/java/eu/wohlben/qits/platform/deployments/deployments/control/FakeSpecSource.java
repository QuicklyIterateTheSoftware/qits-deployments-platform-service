/**
 * The suite's stand-in for the git host — {@code @Mock}, so no {@code @QuarkusTest} in this module
 * ever makes cd's one outbound HTTP call.
 *
 * <p><b>Its default answer is a DECLARED {@link DeploymentSpec#DEFAULTS}</b> — a repository that
 * carries the file and sets nothing in it — which is the backward compatibility contract in one
 * line: it behaves exactly as every repository did before the file existed. A test that wants a
 * spec scripts one for its repository by name.
 *
 * <p><b>A repository with NO FILE is a different answer and is scripted separately</b> ({@link
 * #scriptNoSpec}). The two produce the same spec and the release door treats them differently: a
 * file that says nothing asks for the conventional deployment, and no file asks for none. Keeping
 * the default on the declared side is what keeps every test that only wants "and then it deploys"
 * saying that.
 *
 * <p>Application-scoped and therefore shared: reset it in {@code @BeforeEach} and use distinct
 * repository ids per test. State is read through methods only — the injected reference is a CDI
 * client proxy.
