/**
 * <b>The two role sets, and the fact that they do not overlap.</b>
 *
 * <p>Every endpoint of this surface carries a {@code @RolesAllowed} and there are exactly two roles.
 * {@code qits-platform:system} is a machine's and arrives only in an idp-minted bearer; it opens the
 * build intake, every topology write and the rollback pins. {@code qits-platform:admin} is a
 * person's and arrives only as the {@code X-Qits-Roles} header the platform edge asserts for an
 * authenticated admin session; it opens every read.
 *
 * <p>A machine token never carries the admin role and a browser session never carries the system
 * one — so each credential is refused by the other's doors, and it is refused with <b>403 rather
 * than 401</b>: the caller authenticated perfectly, and what it is missing is a grant. Knowing which
 * of the two shut is how a missing grant is debugged, and it is why these are three stories rather
 * than one.
 *
 * <p><b>Every story here also claims an absence, and the absence is the point.</b> A refused build
 * event must reach neither the git host nor the orchestrator: a component that read a repository's
 * spec before deciding whether the caller may deploy would be doing work on behalf of anybody who
 * can reach its port. So each diagram is one arrow in and nothing out at all.
 *
 * <p>None of this is provable in a {@code @QuarkusTest}. {@code qits-auth-core}'s {@code %test} dev
 * identity holds every platform role and is {@code LaunchMode}-guarded, so inside the suite no route
 * here refuses anybody; a launched artifact runs in {@code NORMAL} mode with {@code
 * qits.auth.machine.required=true}, and that is the only posture in which these answers exist.

      the build intake it uses every day. It opens none of the reads.

      That is a decision rather than an omission. The read surface describes the whole platform —
      which applications exist, which tiers they are in, what was deployed and what failed — and it
      is a person's, projected into the client an admin session reaches. A machine that could read
      it would be a machine that could enumerate the platform with a credential granted for one
      narrow write. So the two sets are disjoint, and a peer asking the wrong question is told 403

      The machine surface is a machine's because of what is behind it: the intake queues a
