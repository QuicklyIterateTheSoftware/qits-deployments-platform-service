/**
 * {@code GET /platform-deployments/api/pins} over real deployments, driven through the intake exactly as a green
 * build drives it — the shape a garbage collector binds to, and the proof that the pins follow the
 * cutover rather than restating it.
 *
 * <p>The listing is instance-wide, so every case reads its own application's entry out of it rather
 * than asserting the whole document: the suite shares one database and other classes deploy too.
 *
 * <p>It reads nothing but deployment rows, and that independence is the claim this suite carries
 * over from the retired outage suite: qits-platform-artifacts' image GC is fail-closed on this
 * answer, so a pin that needed the service catalogue would tie garbage collection platform-wide to
 * a second query. Everything the rule reads — the name, the tier, the sha, the status — is on the
 * row.
