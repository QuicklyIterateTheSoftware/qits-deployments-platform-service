/**
 * <b>A recording docker stand-in</b>, and the tap that draws what a deployment asked the swarm
 * manager for.
 *
 * <h2>Why an executable and not an HTTP mock</h2>
 *
 * <p>This component does not speak to dockerd over a socket: {@code deployments/control/PdProcess}
 * <b>spawns the docker CLI</b> and reads its pipes, and which binary that is arrives as one runtime
 * key, {@code qits.platform.deployments.container-runtime}. So the honest stand-in for the one
 * dependency a deployment has is not a stubbed endpoint — it is an executable. Pointing that key at
 * the script this class writes makes the orchestrator hop <b>observable</b> rather than declared:
 * every call lands in a file with the exit code it answered, and enough state lives under {@code
 * state/} that {@code SwarmDeploymentDriver}'s own reasoning runs for real against it — does the
 * service exist, is this update the one I issued, what environment does the live service carry.
 *
 * <p>That matters more than the convenience. A story that reached for a real daemon would break
 * this repository's first rule (a clone builds and tests green with no docker, and this suite's
 * container has no socket to reach); a story that only <i>declared</i> the swarm edge would document
 * the dependency this component exists for as a claim rather than as evidence. The choice was never
 * between a daemon and a stand-in — it was between a claim and a recording, and this is the
 * recording.
 *
 * <h2>Everything shared is a file or a system property</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #install()} is called from the {@code QuarkusTestProfile}, because the launched process
 * needs the binary's path before it boots — and a test profile is instantiated in more than one
 * classloader, so the directory travels in a system property exactly as the embedded postgres' url
 * does. The stand-in itself runs as a <b>separate process</b>, a child of the launched artifact,
 * which is why its recording is a file and not a list in a field: no two of the three JVMs and
 * processes involved share a heap.
 *
 * <h2>The recording has no floor, and the boot makes no calls</h2>
 *
 * <p>The source is registered at zero rather than at the current end of the file, the way {@code
 * qits-containers}' does — and here that is a claim rather than a convenience. This component's
 * boot touches the orchestrator <b>not at all</b>: the startup sweep iterates the {@code
 * QUEUED}/{@code STARTING} rows and a fresh database has none, and the observation ticker is switched
 * off in the story profile (see {@link StoryProfile}). So the first story to drain owns everything
 * from process start, and if that is ever not nothing its edge count fails loudly — which is the
 * right way for the assumption to break.
 *
 * <h2>What a line becomes</h2>
 *
 * <p>The script records the exit code and the whole argv, tab separated. {@link #summarize} reduces
 * the argv to the shape a reader needs — {@code service create story-tier-story-web}, {@code service
 * update-status story-tier-story-web}, {@code pull …/story-web:{sha}} — and never the whole command
 * line, for the two reasons a label is a summary at all: a {@code service create} carries {@code
 * --label qits.platform.deployments.deployment=<uuid>}, which is generated per run and would move
 * the {@code networkHash} on every one, and a Go {@code --format} template is full of braces that
 * mermaid reads as syntax. The exit code follows as {@code -> 0}, in the shape an HTTP label's
 * status has, because it is the same half of the evidence: that the call was <i>answered</i>, not
 * merely made.
 *
 * <p><b>Four {@code service inspect} shapes are told apart by their intent</b>, not by their flags —
 * "does it exist" ({@code {{.ID}}}), "how did my update go" ({@code UpdateStatus}), "what is it
 * running" ({@code ContainerSpec.Image}) and "what environment does it carry" ({@code
 * ContainerSpec.Env}). They are four different questions in the driver and reading them as one
 * arrow would hide the whole update path.
