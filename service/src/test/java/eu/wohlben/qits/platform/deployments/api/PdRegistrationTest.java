/**
 * Derived registration and deploy resolution: what a green build <b>writes</b> into the catalogue,
 * and what it <b>reads back</b> to decide where to deploy.
 *
 * <p>The ancestor's version of this suite ran against a stub HTTP server standing in for
 * qits-serviceregistry, and had a twin ({@code CdRegistryOutageTest}) for the case where the peer
 * was down. Both dissolved with the merge: registration is a local transaction, so there is no wire
 * to stub and no outage to have a posture about. Every claim the first suite made survives here,
 * asserted through this component's own read surface instead of through a stub's recorded calls.
 * The claims of the second are gone with the failure mode — except one, which was never about the
 * peer at all and is held by {@code PdPinApiTest}: the pins read nothing but deployment rows.
