/**
 * The whole service as it is <b>packaged</b> — the fast-jar under {@code mvn verify
 * -DskipITs=false}, the GraalVM binary under {@code mvn verify -Dnative}. The assertions are chosen
 * for what a native build can silently lose rather than for API coverage (that is the
 * {@code @QuarkusTest} suite's job):
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the routes are where the config says — {@code quarkus.rest.path} and {@code
 *       quarkus.http.non-application-root-path} are build-time settings baked into the artifact;
 *   <li>the shipped datasource <b>expression</b> resolves and connects, and {@code
 *       db/platformdeployments/migration/} survived as a resource — migrations are loaded by
 *       scanning a classpath location, exactly the shape native-image drops, and the claim reaches
 *       every table the component has, since one request writes the topology and another writes a
 *       deployment row;
 *   <li>both domains round-trip through Hibernate/Panache in the packaged process, in one
 *       transaction each. That is a claim the ancestors could not make: a deployment row and the
 *       topology it names lived in two databases behind an HTTP call.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>It is also <b>the only test here that ever sees the client</b>. Quinoa is disabled by default
 * in test mode, so no {@code @QuarkusTest} in this repo has a client in it at all — a unit test
 * asserting something about what is served would pass against a process serving nothing. What the
 * SPA is actually served as is proven here or nowhere.
 *
 * <p><b>The client is served at the root</b> since this service got a host of its own
 * ({@code deployments.<env>.<domain>}). The segment survives only as the wire prefix, so
 * {@code /platform-deployments/} is a 404 rather than a second door into the client, and an old
 * bookmark is the edge's problem, answered there with a redirect.
 *
 * <p>No deployment is driven here: that needs a swarm, and the packaged process carries the real
 * {@link eu.wohlben.qits.platform.deployments.swarmhost.SwarmDeploymentDriver}. The container
 * runtime is pointed at a binary that does not exist, which exercises the best-effort seam (an
 * environment must exist even when docker is unreachable) and keeps this IT free of host side
 * effects.

   * reach the launched process as system properties, so the same six names resolve.
   *
   * <p><b>Both are mandatory, which is itself the claim.</b> Neither jar's expressions have a
