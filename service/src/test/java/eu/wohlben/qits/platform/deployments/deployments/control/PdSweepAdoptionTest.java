/**
 * The startup sweep settles an in-flight row from what is RUNNING, package-local so the suite can
 * drive {@link DeployService#sweepInFlight()} without a real StartupEvent.
 *
 * <p>That is the half of a self-update no orchestrator does for us: the instance that deployed
 * itself died before it could record the outcome, so the next one asks what the service is running
 * and compares it with the row's own IMAGE TAG — the released version, and the commit sha behind
 * it on a row written before versions were the coordinate. Carrying that tag is this deployment
 * serving; carrying another is a rollback or a later deployment; nothing running at all is a row a
 * restart interrupted.
 *
 * <p><b>Most rows here are written the LEGACY way, with a sha and no version</b>, and that is
 * deliberate: it is the arm that says a row predating the version column still adopts rather than
 * coming back SUPERSEDED by its own successor. {@link #aRowDeployedByAReleaseIsAdoptedOnItsVersion}
 * is the other arm.
 *
 * <p>The rows are written straight to the table rather than through an environment, and that is the
 * point since the extraction: the sweep must read nothing but this component's own columns.
