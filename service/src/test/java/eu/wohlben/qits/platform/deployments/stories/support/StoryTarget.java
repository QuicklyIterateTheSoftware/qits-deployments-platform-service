/**
 * The one launched process, addressed the way every one of its surfaces is addressed — and named
 * the way a diagram names it.
 *
 * <p>{@code quarkus.rest.path=/platform-deployments/api} is the JSON API and {@code
 * quarkus.http.non-application-root-path=/platform-deployments/q} is what Quarkus itself serves, so
 * the framework's shipped RestAssured tap — which skips any path carrying a {@code /q/}
 * <i>segment</i> rather than a leading one — is exactly right here and no story class overrides the
 * predicate. That is the line to re-read when this class is copied: a service whose probe root is
 * {@code /q} rather than {@code /<segment>/q} would need a different check.
 *
 * <p>The <b>port is random</b> — failsafe launches the artifact with {@code
 * quarkus.http.test-port=0} — so nothing here is a constant except the paths, and RestAssured is
 * handed the port by the Quarkus integration-test extension. Only {@link StoryPlatform}'s
 * tap-invisible fixture client builds a url of its own, and it reads {@code RestAssured.port} for
 * exactly that reason.
 *
 * <p><b>Every tier, application, project and commit a story uses is a stable literal</b>, never a
 * run stamp. A name is a whole path segment and {@link Labels} rewrites only segments it can tell
 * were generated (a uuid, a long hex run, a bare number); {@code story-web} is none of those and
 * would survive into a label exactly as written, so a stamped one would move every {@code
 * networkHash} on every run. The commit shas <b>are</b> long hex and are rewritten — which is the
 * point: a sha is generated, and the git host's blob url is template-shaped because of it.
 *
 * <p><b>A query string never reaches a label from the shipped tap.</b> {@code
 * NetworkTaps.restAssured} labels {@code METHOD <scrubbed PATH> -> <status>} and drops the query
 * entirely. The deployment listing's {@code ?environmentId=<uuid>} is the one genuinely run-local
 * value a story of this catalogue sends, and it is invisible to the diagram for that reason rather
 * than because anything here templated it. The corollary is the trap: two routes differing only in
 * their query are ONE edge, so a story that wanted them apart has to address different paths.
