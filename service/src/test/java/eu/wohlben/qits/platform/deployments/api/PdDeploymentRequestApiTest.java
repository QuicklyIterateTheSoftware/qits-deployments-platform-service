/**
 * {@code GET /platform-deployments/api/deployment-requests} over real releases, driven through the
 * intake exactly as a release drives it.
 *
 * <p>What this surface exists to say, and what nothing else can: <b>a version was asked for here,
 * and this is what the gate did with it</b>. The deployments listing answers a different question —
 * what ran — and a request the gate refused never becomes a row in it, so the refusal would be
 * invisible. The gate is a placeholder that says yes to everything today, which is why the cases
 * below assert the shape of a MET request and its edge back to the deployment rather than a
 * refusal: the refusal has no producer yet, and inventing one in a test would assert a fiction.
 *
 * <p>The listing is tier-scoped, so every case makes its own environment. Creating one MOVES the
 * designation, which is what makes a release land in it.
