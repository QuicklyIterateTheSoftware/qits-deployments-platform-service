/**
 * <b>What the platform looks like once things have been deployed onto it</b> — the two readers of
 * this surface, and the two very different questions they ask.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>A person</b> reads the whole shape: the tiers, the catalogue, the applications and one
 *       tier's deployment history. Four routes, four answers, and every one of them comes out of one
 *       database in one process — a claim the ancestors could not make, because the topology used to
 *       be a second service on the far side of an HTTP call.
 *   <li><b>A machine</b>, qits-platform-artifacts' OCI garbage collector, asks the far smaller
 *       question its sweep depends on: which image shas must survive. Answering it costs this
 *       component <b>nothing but rows</b> — no orchestrator call, no peer, no topology read — which
 *       is exactly why a collector can afford to ask before every sweep and to abort when it
 *       cannot.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>These stories read what {@code stories.deployment} deployed</b>, so they run after it. That
 * is stated with {@code @UserflowRunsAfter} as well as being true of the package names, and it is a
 * real dependency rather than tidiness: an overview of a platform nothing has been deployed onto
 * would be an empty page asserting nothing. Run this class on its own and it fails loudly, which is
 * the right way for that assumption to break.

      Nothing on this surface is open, and the role says who a caller is meant to be: every read
      here takes qits-platform:admin, which reaches this service only as a forwarded X-Qits-Roles
      header from an authenticated admin session. A machine bearer never carries it, so the read
      half is a person's and stays one.

      The four reads answer four different questions and are deliberately not one endpoint. The
      tiers say which branches deploy where. The catalogue says which services exist and which tiers
      each is linked into — one row per service, and it round-trips into the upsert. The
      applications listing is the same data one row per (service, tier), flat because a platform
      service belongs to no tier and reading through the tiers would leave out the two a reader most
      wants to find. And the deployment listing is history, scoped to one plane, reporting every
      attempt rather than only what is serving.
