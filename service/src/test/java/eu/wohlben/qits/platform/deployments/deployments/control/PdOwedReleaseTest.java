/**
 * <b>Acceptance is durable: a release accepted from the bus is deployed even if the process that
 * accepted it dies before deploying it.</b>
 *
 * <p>The defect this holds shut, measured on 2026-09-05. qits-eventstream claims a {@code
 * SoftwareRelease} in {@code consumed_event} the moment the subscriber's handler returns — and the
 * handler returns as soon as the release is a {@code Runnable} on the in-memory {@code
 * pd-deploy-worker} queue, which is serialized platform-wide, is legitimately an hour deep, and is
 * discarded by {@code @PreDestroy}. So every cutover of this component (which it performs on
 * itself, {@code stop-first}) dropped the whole queue while the bus's ledger correctly said the
 * events had been handled: the successor's catch-up found the claims and skipped them, and no
 * deployment request was ever written. Seven applications went that way between 13:00 and 17:15
 * UTC; four had to be replayed by hand.
 *
 * <p><b>A dead process is staged by writing its row, not by killing a JVM.</b> The whole re-drive
 * predicate is {@code accepted_by}: an obligation stamped with an instance id that is not this
 * process's belonged to a queue that did not survive. A test writes exactly that row — which is the
 * state a crash leaves, byte for byte — and then runs the sweep the successor runs at boot.
 *
 * <p>Every method creates its own environment and releases its own application, because the suite
 * shares one database across classes and {@link ReleaseTips} keeps a per-process memory of what it
 * announced. Each environment is created as the PLATFORM one, which moves the designation and makes
 * it the tier the method's releases enter at.
