 * so the pass is driven directly ({@link DeploymentObserver#observeOnce()}) and enqueued directly
 * ({@link DeployService#enqueueObservation()}), the {@link PdSweepAdoptionTest} shape: no tick runs
 * under a {@code @QuarkusTest}, because {@code onStart} returns early in test mode.
 *
 * <p>Rows are written straight to the table, like the sweep's tests, because the states under test are
 * ones no deployment can be talked into producing on demand — a {@code FAILED} row whose container is
 * nonetheless healthy is precisely the accident (eaa34fbc) this class exists for.
