/**
 * The suite's stand-in for the postgres seam — a scripted fake, not an honest one: it provisions
 * nothing, records every request, and answers what the test told it to. {@code @Mock} makes it the
 * {@link ResourceProvisioner} for every {@code @QuarkusTest} in this module, which is what keeps a
 * clone's {@code mvn verify} free of any server it did not start itself.
 *
 * <p>It is one of THREE fakes now, beside {@link FakeDeploymentDriver} and {@link FakeSpecSource} —
 * the same rule applied a third time. What a real postgres does with these requests is proven
 * against a real postgres, in {@code PgResourceProvisionerTest}; what the ORCHESTRATION does with
 * the answers is proven here.
 *
 * <p>Application-scoped and therefore shared across tests: reset it in {@code @BeforeEach} and use
 * distinct application and environment names per test. State is exposed through <b>methods only</b>
 * — the injected reference is a CDI client proxy, and a field read on a proxy sees the proxy's own
 * fields, never the bean's.
