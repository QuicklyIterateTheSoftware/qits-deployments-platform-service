/**
 * A tier WRITE holds through a lost connection, and it lands exactly once.
 *
 * <p>The read seam next door ({@link PdReadPatienceTest}) can retry anything, because re-running a
 * read is not a second effect. A write cannot, and that is the whole reason {@code DbRetry.inNewTx}
 * exists: it owns the transaction, so an attempt that failed inside the body is an attempt that was
 * rolled back and certainly never committed. These two tests are the two halves of that claim on
 * this component's own write path.
 *
 * <p><b>The failure is injected AFTER the insert, on purpose.</b> {@code EnvironmentService.create}
 * persists the row and then asks whether any tier is the platform one; the stand-in throws there, so
 * the first attempt really does write and really is rolled back. A second attempt then writes again,
 * and "exactly one environment of that name exists" is the assertion that says the retry cost the
 * database nothing — which a failure injected before the insert could never show.
 *
 * <p>The stand-in is the suite's own idiom: the real repository, extended rather than delegated to,
 * because the injected reference is a CDI client proxy and a delegating call through it would come
 * straight back here. It throws what a cutover throws ({@code 57P01} under Hibernate's {@code
 * JDBCConnectionException}), so the classification under test is the real one.
