/**
 * The service catalogue: the upsert's semantics, the link-set replacement, and the link query.
 *
 * <p><b>There is one shape of service here now, and this suite is what is left after the platform
 * plane was deleted.</b> It used to hold four rules and it holds one: the link set is replaced,
 * never merged. The other three each said something about a column the catalogue no longer has —
 * "a platform service carries no links" (a 400), "the plane flip is one-way" (a 409 backwards), and
 * "state a deploymentTarget or be refused" (a 400) — and every one of them is gone rather than
 * moved, because there is no second shape of row to validate a write against. Where such a rule had
 * a test, the test below states the property that replaced it and names the claim it used to make,
 * so a reader who remembers the old behaviour can see what happened to it rather than wondering
 * whether it was merely forgotten.
 *
 * <p>Every test names its own environments and services — the suite shares one in-memory database
 * across classes, so a shared name is a test that passes alone and fails in a run, and an assertion
 * about the SIZE of a listing is a test that passes alone and fails beside a foreign class's rows.
 * Assert with {@code hasItem} and {@code find{}}.
 *
 * <p><b>One hazard that used to make that worse is gone.</b> A platform service leaked into
 * <em>every</em> environment's link query, including the ones other test classes had just created,
 * because carrying no link was how the plane said "present everywhere" — so a service registered
 * here changed the answer a test over there read. A service linked nowhere is now in no tier's
 * answer at all, so the only rows that can appear in a link query are the ones something linked
 * into that exact tier. The naming discipline above still stands; the cross-class leak it was also
 * guarding against does not exist any more.
