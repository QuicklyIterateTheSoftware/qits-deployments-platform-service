 * not any more, and staging a real green build to reach that state would assert the deployment path
 * a second time rather than this one.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here waits on the worker</b>, and that is the assertion rather than an omission:
 * this door issues no orchestrator call, so it answers 200 with the write already done. A test that
 * needed {@code awaitIdle()} would mean the door had grown a queue it has no reason to have.
