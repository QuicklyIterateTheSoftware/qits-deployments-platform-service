  // the plane, and the `<env>-<app>` services those rows named were retired once the first platform
  // deployment reported healthy (the 2026-09-07 `dev-qits-configuration` incident).
  //
  // They are not moved to a one-tier claim because there is no one-tier claim to move them to: the
  // plane is deleted, `registerPlatform` and `retireConvertedTierServices` are deleted, and a flip
  // between planes is not a thing a repository can ask for or a catalogue can record. Keeping them

  // changing. `theTierQualifiedNameIsWhatIsCreatedAndTheBareOneIsLeftBehind` below is what pins that

    // take: the deployer refusing to deploy its own fix. `deployment_target` had been retired in the
    // parser — every spec read as ENVIRONMENT — while `register` still routed on the SPEC's target
    // and `registerInEnvironments` refused an application the catalogue held as PLATFORM. From
    // release 2026.923.142928 every deployment of all nine platform services came back
    // "[refused: <app> is a platform service and this commit asks for deployment_target:
    // environment...]", qits-deployments' own next version included. Ten refusals, with
    // environment-tier applications deploying green throughout.
    //
    // The old test pinned the fix: the CATALOGUE decides the plane, so a spec saying ENVIRONMENT
    // about a PLATFORM row takes the platform arm. That claim is meaningless now — there is no plane
    // to keep and one register arm to take — so what is pinned here is the incident's two actual
    // signatures, both of which outlive the plane:
    //
    //   * A RE-RELEASE OF AN ALREADY-REGISTERED APPLICATION IS NEVER REFUSED. A `FAILED` row written
    //     by registration, for an application that deployed perfectly well the release before, is
    //     the incident's exact fingerprint whatever the reason. `register` has one arm and
    //     `recordRejection` has no caller, so there is nothing left that can write one — and this is
    //     what would go red if a routing decision or a refusal came back.
    //   * ITS ADDRESS DOES NOT MOVE BETWEEN RELEASES. A swarm service's name IS its address and
    //     swarm cannot rename one, so an alias that differed from one deployment of an application
    //     to the next would create a second service beside the one that is serving and leave every
    //     peer dialling a name nothing answers to. That is the hazard the old test's alias assertion
