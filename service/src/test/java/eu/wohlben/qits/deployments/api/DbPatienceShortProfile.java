 * The read-patience deadline, shortened so a test can watch it run out.
 *
 * <p>The shipped value is 15S ({@code application.properties}), which is the right number for a
 * request held while a container restarts and the wrong one for a suite: the "still failing after
 * the deadline" claim has to actually reach the deadline. It is overridden here rather than in
 * {@code src/test/resources/application.properties} on purpose — that file carries only what every
 * test needs, and re-declaring a shipped setting there makes the whole suite green about a value no
 * deployment gets.
