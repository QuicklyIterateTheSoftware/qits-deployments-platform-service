 * A deployment that was never told the postgres superuser's password — the shipped state, since

 *
 * <p>The empty value is what makes it absent rather than blank: SmallRye reads an empty string as
 * ABSENT, which is the same fact {@code LegacyNetworkOffProfile} turns on its head for the network
 * key. It needs a profile, and therefore a Quarkus restart, because the value is injected as an
 * {@code Optional<String>} at bean creation and nothing in the process can take it away later.
