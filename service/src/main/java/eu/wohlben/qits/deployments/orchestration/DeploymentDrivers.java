/**
 * The guard on {@code qits.platform.deployments.orchestrator}: it must say {@code swarm}.
 *
 * <p><b>It used to be a producer that picked between two drivers</b>, and it is a guard because the
 * docker path is gone: there is one implementation, so ordinary injection resolves {@code @Inject
 * DeploymentDriver} with nothing to decide. The key stays anyway, and only as a refusal — a
 * deployment carrying a value from before the migration configures an orchestrator this build does
 * not have, and failing the boot naming it is a much better answer than deploying the platform with
 * whatever is left.
 *
 * <p>A {@code StartupEvent} rather than an {@code @IfBuildProperty}, for the reason the producer was
 * one: it has to be a deployment's answer, checked where the deployment's config is.
