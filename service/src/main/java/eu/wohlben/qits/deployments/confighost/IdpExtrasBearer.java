/**
 * The {@code configuration} named oidc client, and the reason this component holds one at all.
 *
 * <p>AGENTS.md records that {@code RegistryBearer} and the whole {@code quarkus-oidc-client} block
 * were deleted when the topology stopped being a peer — "if this service ever calls a guarded peer
 * again, all three arrive in that commit". qits-configuration is that peer: its read surface takes a
 * machine bearer for the {@code <env>-qits-configuration} audience, so the extension, the shipped-off
 * switch and the secret a deployment supplies are back, and they are back for exactly one caller.
 *
 * <p><b>The switch is the extension's own</b>, {@code
 * quarkus.oidc-client.configuration.client-enabled}, false in the shipped properties. There is no
 * key of ours beside it — the sibling arrangement in qits-workspaces, and one switch cannot
 * disagree with itself. Off, this answers empty and the read goes out anonymous; a platform running
 * qits-configuration behind forward-auth on its own network is a supported posture during the
 * migration.
 *
 * <p><b>A token this cannot mint is empty rather than an exception.</b> The refusal that matters
 * belongs to the read itself: an anonymous read of a guarded service comes back 401, and {@link
 * ConfigHostExtrasSource} refuses the deployment naming the url and the status. Throwing here would
 * report the same failure one layer earlier and less usefully.
