/**
 * The sole production implementation of {@link SpecSource}: one {@code GET} against the platform
 * git host's blob endpoint ({@code qits.platform.deployments.git-host-url}), the same contract
 * qits-ci reads a pipeline definition through.
 *
 * <pre>
 * GET &lt;git-host-url&gt;/git/&lt;projectId&gt;/&lt;repoName&gt;/blob/&lt;rev&gt;/.config/qits/deployments.yml
 * GET &lt;git-host-url&gt;/git/&lt;repoId&gt;/blob/&lt;rev&gt;/.config/qits/deployments.yml
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>The rev is the RELEASED TAG, and it is fully qualified.</b> A deployment is a version now,
 * so the file that decides where its container runs has to be the file that version was cut from —
 * {@code refs/tags/2026.903.113443}, never the tip of a branch and never a bare tag name (a branch
 * of the same name would win). The git host takes a rev as one path segment and its own charset
 * refuses a literal {@code /}, so the slashes are percent-encoded; jgit's {@code
 * Repository#resolve} then peels an annotated tag for us.
 *
 * <p><b>The answer carries the commit the tag resolved to</b>, in the {@code Git-Commit-Sha}
 * header, and that is why this returns a {@link SpecRead} rather than a spec. The git host offers
 * no ref-resolution endpoint at all, so without this header a released deployment could record no
 * commit — and the edge from a container back to a diff would be gone. One request, both answers.
 *
 * <p><b>Two addresses for one blob, and the first is the one to use.</b> The git host's repository
 * key is an opaque storage UUID now, and {@code /git/<repoId>} is its internal scheme; the public
 * address is {@code (projectId, repoName)} and it is what a build event carries. So an announcement
 * with the name pair is read name-addressed, and one without it — an older publisher, or a push
 * that arrived on the internal route — keeps the id URL, which is exactly the request this made
 * before the pair existed.
 *
 * <p>This is the component's <b>only</b> outbound HTTP call, and it is deliberately made with the
 * JDK's own client rather than a generated REST client — one request, one path, no model to share.
 * Every path segment was validated at the intake (the slug discipline for the id, the project and
 * the name; a hex sha) before anything reached here, so none can leave the path it is written into.
 *
 * <p>It used to be one of two: the topology was another service, and every registration and every
 * resolution was a second client with a second failure mode. The merge left this one.
 *
 * <p><b>404 is an answer, not a failure.</b> A repository that carries no spec gets every default
 * and deploys exactly as it did before the file existed. Every other outcome — a refused
 * connection, a 500, a 403, a timeout, an unparseable file — raises {@link SpecException} and stops
 * the deployment: the spec decides where the container runs and what may reach it, and a guess
 * there is worse than a recorded failure.
 *
 * <p><b>Those failures are not all the same failure, and this class is where the difference is
 * decided.</b> A {@code SpecException} carries {@link SpecException#retryable()}, and everything
 * raised here that never saw the file — a transport failure, a 5xx, a 401/403/408/429 — says yes,
 * so the deployment is recorded {@code SPEC_UNREADABLE} and read again rather than stranded. What
 * the parser raises on a file it DID read says no. See {@link #statusFailure}.
