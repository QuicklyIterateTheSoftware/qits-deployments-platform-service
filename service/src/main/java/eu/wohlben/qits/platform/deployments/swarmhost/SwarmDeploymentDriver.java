/**
 * The swarm implementation of {@link DeploymentDriver}: a deployed application is a <b>service</b>,
 * and a replace is {@code docker service update --image} on it.
 *
 * <p><b>The whole cutover is flags.</b> {@code --update-order start-first} is the overlap, {@code
 * --update-monitor} is the gate window, {@code --update-failure-action rollback} is the rollback,
 * and a task does not enter DNS until its healthcheck passes — measured on this host: while a task
 * was {@code Starting}, {@code getent hosts} answered nothing for its name while the VIP already
 * existed. So there is no predecessor to find, nothing to stop, nothing to restart and nobody to
 * referee: this class issues one command and then reads a verdict.
 *
 * <p><b>The name is the address, and that is the one thing to keep in mind reading this.</b> {@code
 * container_name} does not exist in swarm — a task container is {@code
 * <service>.<slot>.<taskid>} — so the service NAME is what peers resolve, which makes it the wire
 * alias and makes a replace an update of the same service rather than a second container beside the
 * first. Every question this component asks afterwards ({@code awaitConverged}, {@code observe},
 * the environment teardown) is a service query, never a container name match.
 *
 * <p><b>The topology collapses to two overlays, and it is not a simplification for its own
 * sake.</b> {@code service update --network-add} recreates the task, so a hub-and-spoke topology —
 * one network per application, joined after the fact by every hub and every platform service —
 * would turn a single deployment into a restart storm across the platform. So a service declares
 * its whole membership at create time: {@code
 * qits.platform.deployments.swarm.flat-network} (attachable, so plain {@code docker run} containers
 * — CI steps, workspaces, agents — keep working on it) plus {@code qits-platform} for a platform
 * service. The per-application networks the caller asks for are dropped, deliberately and out loud.
 *
 * <p><b>What a service keeps across an update</b> is its mounts, its networks and its published
 * ports: {@link #buildUpdateArgv} changes the image, the identity labels, the environment and the
 * update policy, and nothing else. Changing the SHAPE of a service — a new volume, another port —
 * is therefore a {@code service rm} and a redeploy, which is the honest reading of it: a change of
 * shape is not a deployment.
 *
 * <p><b>Two verbs here are not swarm-shaped at all</b>, and they are kept for what they answer:
 * {@code docker pull} classifies a missing image (swarm pulls on its own, but a task that never
 * starts is a much worse way to learn that nothing published this build), and {@code docker network
 * ls} reads the membership bookkeeping back whatever created the networks.
 *
 * <p><b>What a deployment adds beyond its image</b> — mounts, published ports, groups, environment
 * — is {@link ServiceExtras}, stated in deployment config and rendered here in swarm's own words.
 * Nothing translates a {@code docker run} argv any more: config states the intent, and the one
 * intent swarm cannot express — a publish bound to an ip — is refused rather than widened.
 *
 * <p><b>The one piece of a self-update swarm does not do for us is the row.</b> The instance that
 * issues the update on its own service dies before the outcome exists, so the deployment stays
 * {@code STARTING} until an instance boots that can settle it — from {@link #runningImage}, the
 * image the service is running, which is the only reading that tells a completed succession from a
 * rolled-back one.

   * identity this deployment stamps on the service, the replica count, and the policy the update
   * itself runs under.
   *
   * <p><b>The replica count is restated and that is a decision, not symmetry with the create.</b> It
   * is desired state rather than shape — see the flag's own comment below — and leaving it alone
   * would let a deployment onto a service an operator had scaled to 0 report a green {@code ACTIVE}
   * row with nothing running behind it.
   *
   * <p><b>The publish MODE rides with the ports, so changing it is not a deployment.</b> A
   * repository that starts saying {@code publish_mode: ingress} is describing a different shape of
   * service, and an existing service keeps the mode it was created with until it is removed and
   * created again — the {@code service rm} and redeploy every shape change here takes.
   *
   * <p><b>The network ALIASES ride with the networks, so changing them is not a deployment
   * either.</b> An attachment is restated as a whole or not at all: swarm has no add-an-alias, and
   * {@code --network-add} of a network the service is already on is an error. So a service that is
   * gaining or losing an alias takes {@code service update --network-rm <net> --network-add
   * name=<net>,alias=…} by hand — which recreates the task — or the {@code service rm} and redeploy.
   * A deployment after that keeps whatever the service holds, which is why an alias declared in
   * config reaches a LIVE service only on its next create.
   *
   * <p><b>The environment is the exception, and it is re-stated in full</b> — this component's own
   * variables and the deployment config's alike. A variable is a value rather than a shape: config
   * naming a new address is a change the next deployment is supposed to carry, and {@code
   * --env-add} of an existing key replaces it.
   *
   * <p><b>Re-stated in full means REMOVALS too</b>, which it did not until 2026-08-17: see {@link
