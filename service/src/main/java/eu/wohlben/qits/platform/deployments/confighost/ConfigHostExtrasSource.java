/**
 * The sole production implementation of {@link DeploymentExtrasSource}: the config volume's file,
 * or — where a deployment names one — qits-configuration <b>instead of it</b>.
 *
 * <pre>
 * GET &lt;extras-url&gt;/configuration/api/applications/&lt;app&gt;/envs/&lt;env&gt;/resolved?version=&lt;version&gt;
 *   → {"headRevision": 7, "properties": {"qits.platform.deployments.extras.&lt;app&gt;.&lt;key&gt;": "…"}}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>The read is addressed by the PLACE and the RELEASE now, and the body is the same body.</b>
 * It used to name the application alone, which could only ever describe one configuration per
 * platform; a tier segment and a version parameter are what make it possible for {@code dev} and
 * {@code prod} to differ and for a rollback to bring back the configuration that version was
 * released with. Nothing about the answer changed — same document, same {@code headRevision} and
 * {@code properties}, same single parser one layer up.
 *
 * <p><b>...but the version is asked for only when the release SEEDED one.</b> The parameter is what
 * turns this into the OVERLAY read, and the store answers 404 for a version it holds no declaration
 * for — which is right, because "resolve me against this document" cannot be answered with a
 * document that is not there. The deployer seeds a declaration only for a release whose tag carries
 * {@code .config/qits/configuration.yml}, and almost no repository has that file yet, so passing the
 * parameter unconditionally refused every deployment of every undeclared repository. Those read the
 * version-less form the store documents as the transitional one, with a WARN naming them — see
 * {@link #versionlessBecauseNothingWasDeclared}.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code qits.platform.deployments.extras-url} unset is today's behaviour byte for byte.</b>
 * No request is made, nothing is parsed, and the answer is {@link ExtrasSnapshot#over(Config,
 * String)} — which is what a dev run, the clone-alone suite and every platform that has not adopted
 * the service still get.
 *
 * <p><b>Set, the service is AUTHORITATIVE — and authoritative means SOLE.</b> The file is not read
 * at all: the served properties over this process's boot config are the whole snapshot. It used to
 * be layered above the file, which read well and deployed badly — a key DELETED from the service
 * came straight back out of a file nobody had emptied, so the one operation the service exists to
 * make possible was the one it could not perform. Two sources cannot both be authoritative, and a
 * file left on the volume is the stale one by construction. The map arrives in the full prefixed
 * spelling, so nothing here translates the extras grammar — {@code ServiceExtras} stays its single
 * parser.
 *
 * <p><b>The rollback is the key.</b> Emptying {@code extras-url} returns this to the file, which may
 * by then be stale — re-render or export it before leaning on it.
 *
 * <p><b>An unreachable or non-200 service REFUSES the deployment.</b> There is deliberately no
 * fall-back to the file, to the boot config or to anything read earlier: a stale extras value is the
 * exact failure that cost 2026-08-16, and a fall-back would ship it as a green deployment. {@link
 * ServiceExtras.Refused} names the url and what happened, and it reaches the deployment's detail
 * through the driver's own refusal arm — the argv is never built, so the deployment changed nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>The patience is the spec read's, stated as two keys.</b> {@code
 * qits.platform.deployments.extras-timeout-seconds} bounds the connect and the read, {@code
 * qits.platform.deployments.extras-attempts} is the whole retry budget — a service being redeployed
 * is seconds of refusals and no deployment should die of one, while an outage that outlasts the
 * budget must be a loud refusal rather than an unbounded wait on the deploy worker, which is
 * single-threaded and has everything else queued behind it.

   * alone — while a version PRESENT means "resolve me against this document" and a version naming no
   * declaration is a 404. Both halves are deliberate over there, and both are right; what was wrong
   * here was passing the parameter unconditionally, because the deployer only seeds a declaration
   * for a release whose tag carries {@code .config/qits/configuration.yml}. Almost no repository on
   * the fleet does yet, so every release of an undeclared one asked the store to resolve against a
   * document nobody had written, was answered 404, and had its deployment refused for the absence of
   * a file it never had.
   *
   * <p><b>The WARN is the transitional signal and it is meant to be read.</b> It names the
   * application and the version, and it says the read was version-less because the release declared
   * nothing — which is precisely the inventory the config-declarations epic's cutover needs: every
   * line here is one repository that still has to grow the file, and the day the log falls silent is
   * the day the parameter can stop being conditional. It is a WARN rather than an INFO because it
   * describes configuration this deployment could NOT resolve declared defaults for, not a routine
   * choice.
   *
   * <p><b>It never covers for a release that DID seed.</b> A 404 on the version-addressed read is a
   * real error — the seed answered 2xx a moment earlier, so the store holds that document and a
   * miss means something is wrong with the store rather than with the repository — and it stays a
   * refused deployment. That is also why this is a decision made from what the release carried
   * rather than a retry on the 404: a retry cannot tell those two 404s apart, and the one it would
   * quietly paper over is the one worth failing on.
