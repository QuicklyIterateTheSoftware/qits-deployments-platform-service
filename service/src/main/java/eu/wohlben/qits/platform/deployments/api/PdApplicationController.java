/**
 * Every application this component deploys, in one flat list — the environments' and the platform's
 * together.
 *
 * <p>It is flat because a platform service carries no LINK into an environment: reading through the
 * environments would leave qits-platform-idp and this component out of it, which are the two a
 * reader most wants to find. Each row says which plane it is on ({@code target}) and, for an
 * environment application, which tier it is linked into ({@code environmentId}/{@code
 * environmentName}). A platform service is nonetheless deployed into the designated environment —
 * the tier it runs in is on its deployment rows, not here, because "no link" is what makes a tier
 * created tomorrow pick it up.
 *
 * <p>Read-only, and that is the model rather than a phase: rows here are derived from each
 * repository's own {@code .config/qits/deployments.yml} on every green build.
 *
 * <p><b>How it differs from {@code GET /services}</b>, which is the same data: this one has one
 * entry per (service, tier) and carries a derived {@code id} the client joins against a
 * deployment's {@code applicationId}; that one has one entry per service, with its link set, and
 * round-trips into the upsert. Two questions, two shapes, one catalogue.
