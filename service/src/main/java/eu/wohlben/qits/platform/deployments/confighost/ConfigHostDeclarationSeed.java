/**
 * The sole production implementation of {@link DeclarationSeed}: one {@code POST} of a released
 * repository's {@code .config/qits/configuration.yml} into qits-configuration, before the deployment
 * that carries it is scheduled.
 *
 * <pre>
 * POST &lt;extras-url&gt;/configuration/api/applications/&lt;app&gt;/declarations/&lt;version&gt;?deploymentTarget=&lt;target&gt;
 *   Content-Type: application/yaml
 *   &lt;the file, verbatim&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>It is {@link ConfigHostExtrasSource}'s sibling and deliberately shares its whole posture</b>
 * — the same base url key, the same forwarded headers, the same bearer, the same two patience keys.
 * That is not economy: it is the same peer. A second url key would let a platform point the write at
 * one qits-configuration and the read at another, which is a way to seed a declaration the
 * deployment then resolves against somebody else's store. A second credential would be a second
 * peer, and the peer count here is one.
 *
 * <p><b>The url unset is a no-op, and it has to be.</b> {@code
 * qits.platform.deployments.extras-url} is unset shipped, which is a platform whose extras come from
 * the config volume's file — there is no store to seed, so a deployment that refused itself for
 * lacking one would be every file-mode platform failing every deployment. It logs at debug and
 * returns, and the deployment proceeds exactly as it did.
 *
 * <p><b>The status map is the whole design and its two halves are asked differently.</b>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>2xx — done.</b> 201 is created, 200 is the idempotent no-op for a version whose content
 *       hash the store already holds. Both are the same answer to this component: the store has this
 *       version's declaration.
 *   <li><b>409 and 422 — {@link DeclarationRefused.Kind#DECLARATION_BROKEN}, immediately and never
 *       retried.</b> A 422 is a file that does not parse and a 409 is a DIFFERENT file under a
 *       version already stored; both are statements about the released tag's own content, and a
 *       second POST of the same bytes gets the same answer. Retrying would spend the budget proving
 *       it.
 *   <li><b>5xx, a timeout, a refused connection — {@link DeclarationRefused.Kind#SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE}
 *       after the budget.</b> The store being redeployed is a few seconds of refusals and no
 *       deployment should die of one; an outage that outlasts the budget must be a loud refusal
 *       rather than an unbounded wait on {@code pd-deploy-worker}, which is single-threaded with
 *       every other event queued behind it. This is {@code ConfigHostExtrasSource}'s argument
 *       verbatim, because it is the same worker and the same peer.
 *   <li><b>Any other 4xx — {@code SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE}, with no retry.</b> A 404 here is a
 *       mis-deployed store rather than patience material: this component built the path, so a route
 *       that is not there will not be there in a second. It is not {@code DECLARATION_BROKEN}
 *       because nothing read the file — sending a person to fix a repository over a 401 would be the
 *       wrong repository.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here parses the body it sends.</b> The bytes are the git host's, and the store is
 * the only thing on the platform that knows the grammar — see {@code SpecSource.readDeclaration}.
 * What this validates is the two values it splices into a URL, and both are belts at the boundary:
 * the application name through the same charset check the resolved read uses, and the version
 * through its own.
